    "Lexical diversity is one aspect of 'lexical richness' and refers to the ratio of different unique word stems (types) to the total number of words (tokens). The term is used in applied linguistics and is quantitatively calculated using numerous different measures including Text-Type Ratio (TTR), vocd,[1] and the measure of textual lexical diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem with lexical diversity measures, especially TTR, is that text samples containing large number of tokens give lower values for TTR since it is often necessary for the writer or speaker to re-use several function words. One consequence of this is that lexical diversity is better used for comparing texts of equal length.[3] Newer measures of lexical diversity attempt to account for sensitivity to text length."

The moral tone is plain. \"She is kind\\nto the old blind man.\"\\n\\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some\\ncontemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given\\nin the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.\\nCounting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson\\nnumbers.\\n\\nEach lesson begins with vocabulary words, followed by the description of a\\npicture (if any) related to the lesson\\'s reading exercise. The lesson then\\nconsists of printed text for reading and sometimes script (handwriting)\\nfor reading or copying.\\n\\nDon Kostuch\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\nECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES.\\n\\nMCGUFFEY\\'S [Registered]\\n\\nFirst\\n\\nECLECTIC READER\\n\\nRevised Edition\\n\\n\\nMcGuffey Edition and Colophon are Trademarks of\\n\\nJOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\\nNEW YORK - CHICHESTER - WEINHEIM - BRISBANE - SINGAPORE - TORONTO\\n\\nSUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.\\n\\nThis First Reader may be used in teaching reading by any of the methods in\\ncommon use; but it is especially adapted to the Phonic Method, the Word\\nMethod, or a combination of the two.\\n\\nI. Phonic Method.--First teach the elementary sounds and their\\nrepresentative, the letters marked with diacriticals, as they occur in the\\nlessons; then, the formation of words by the combination of these sounds.\\nFor instance, teach the pupil to identify the characters a, o, n, d, g, r,\\nand th, in Lesson I, as the representatives of certain elementary sounds;\\nthen teach him to form the words at the head of the lesson, then other\\nwords, as nag, on, and, etc. Pursue a similar course in teaching the\\nsucceeding lessons. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to\\nteach the names of the letters and the spelling of words, and require the\\ngroups, \"a man,\" \"the man,\" \"a pen,\" to be read as a good reader would\\npronounce single words.\\n\\nII.  When one of the letters in the combinations ou or ow, is marked in\\nthe words at the head of the reading exercises, the other is silent. If\\nneither is marked, the two letters represent a diphthong. All other\\nunmarked vowels in the vocabularies, when in combination, are silent\\nletters. In slate or blackboard work, the silent letters may be canceled.\\n\\nIII. Word Method.--Teach the pupil to identify at sight the words placed\\nat the head of the reading exercises, and to read these exercises without\\nhesitation. Having read a few lessons, begin to teach the names of the\\nletters and the spelling of words.\\n\\nIV. Word Method and Phonic Method Combined.--Teach the pupil to identify\\nwords and read sentences, as above. Having read a few lessons in this\\nmanner, begin to use the Phonic Method, combining it with the Word Method,\\nby first teaching the words in each lesson as words; then the elementary\\nsounds, the names of the letters, and spelling.\\n\\nV. Teach the pupil to use script letters in writing, when teaching the\\nnames of the letters and the spelling of words.\\n\\n\\nCopyright, 1879, by Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co.\\nCopyright, 1896, by American Book Company.\\nCopyright, 1907 and 1920, by H.H. Vail.\\n\\nEP486\\n\\n\\n\\nPreface\\n\\nIn presenting McGuffey’s Revised First Reader to the public, attention is\\ninvited to the following features:\\n\\n1. Words of only two or three letters are used in the first lessons.\\nLonger and more difficult ones are gradually introduced as the pupil gains\\naptness in the mastery of words.\\n\\n2. A proper gradation has been carefully preserved. All new words are\\nplaced at the head of each lesson, to be learned before the lesson is\\nread. Their number in the early lessons is very small, thus making the\\nfirst steps easy. All words in these vocabularies are used in the text\\nimmediately following.\\n\\n3. Carefully engraved script exercises are introduced for a double\\npurpose. These should be used to teach the reading of script; and may also\\nserve as copies in slate work.\\n\\n4. The illustrations have been designed and engraved specially for the\\nlessons in which they occur. Many of the engravings will serve admirably\\nas the basis for oral lessons in language.\\n\\n5. The type is large, strong, and distinct.\\n\\nThe credit for this revision is almost wholly due to the  friends of\\nMcGuffey’s Readers,--eminent teachers and scholars, who have contributed\\nsuggestions and criticisms gained from their daily work in the schoolroom.\\n\\nCincinnati, June, 1879.\\n\\n                                                                     (iii)\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ALPHABET.\\n\\nA    a      N   n\\nB    b      O   o\\nC    c      P   p\\nD    d      Q   q\\nE    e      R   r\\nF    f      S   s\\nG    g      T   t\\nH    h      U   u\\nI    i      V   v\\nJ    j      W   w\\nK    k      X   x\\nL    l      Y   y\\nM    m      Z   z\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nScript Alphabet\\n\\nA  B  C  D  E  F  G\\nH  I  J  K  L  M  N\\nO  P  Q  R  S  Y  U\\nV  W  X  Y  Z\\n\\na  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i\\nj  k  l  m  n  o  p  q\\nr  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z\\n\\nSCRIPT FIGURES\\n\\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0\\n]\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: Dog]\\n\\n\\n\\nMcGuffey\\'s FIRST READER.\\n\\n\\n\\nLESSON I.\\n\\ndog   the   ran\\n\\na   o    n   d   g   r   th\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: Running dog.]\\n\\n\\nThe dog.\\n\\nThe dog ran.\\n\\n\\n\\nLESSON II.\\n\\ncat    mat    is    on\\n\\nc    t    i    m    s\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: Cat]\\n\\n\\nThe cat.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.

H. VAIL.\\nM\\'G. REV 5TH EC.\\nEP 310\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE.\\n\\nThe plan of the revision of McGUFFEY\\'S FIFTH READER is the same as that\\npursued in the other books of the REVISED SERIES. The book has been\\nconsiderably enlarged, but the new pieces have been added or substituted\\nonly after the most careful consideration, and where the advantages to be\\nderived were assured.\\n\\nIt has been the object to obtain as wide a range of leading authors as\\npossible, to present the best specimens of style, to insure interest in\\nthe subjects, to impart valuable information, and to exert a decided and\\nhealthful moral influence. Thus the essential characteristics of\\nMcGUFFEY\\'S READERS have been carefully kept intact.\\n\\nThe preliminary exercises have been retained, and are amply sufficient for\\ndrill in articulation, inflection, etc. The additional exercises on these\\nsubjects, formerly inserted between the lessons, have been omitted to make\\nroom for other valuable features of the REVISED SERIES.\\n\\nA full understanding of the text is necessary in order to read it\\nproperly. As all the books of reference required for this purpose are not\\nwithin the reach of the majority of pupils, full explanatory notes have\\nbeen given, which, it is believed, will add greatly not only to the\\ninterest of the reading lessons, but also to their usefulness from an\\ninstructive point of view.\\n\\nThe definitions of the more difficult words have been given, as formerly;\\nand the pronunciation has been indicated by diacritical marks, in\\nconformity with the preceding books of the REVISED SERIES.\\n\\nParticular attention is invited to the notices of authors. Comparatively\\nfew pupils have the opportunity of making a separate study of English and\\nAmerican literature, and the carefully prepared notices in the REVISED\\nSERIES are designed, therefore, to supply as much information in regard to\\nthe leading authors as is possible in the necessarily limited space\\nassigned. The publishers have desired to illustrate McGUFFEY\\'S READERS in\\na manner worthy of the text and of the high favor in which they are held\\nthroughout the United States. The most celebrated designers and engravers\\nof the country have been employed for this purpose.\\n\\nIt has been the privilege of the publishers to submit the REVISIED SERIES\\nto numerous eminent educators in all parts of the country. To the careful\\nreviews and criticisms of these gentlemen is due, in a large measure, the\\npresent form of McGUFFEY\\'S READERS. The value of these criticisms, coming\\nfrom practical sources of the highest authority, can not well be\\noverestimated, and the publishers take this occasion to express their\\nthanks and their indebtedness to all who have thus kindly assisted them in\\nthis work.\\n\\nEspecial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood\\n& Co. for their permission to make liberal selections from their\\ncopyright editions of many of the foremost American authors\\nwhose works they publish.\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS.\\n\\nINTRODUCTORY MATTER.\\n\\n       SUBJECT.\\n I.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS.\\n\\nThe great object to be accomplished in reading, as a rhetorical exercise,\\nis to convey to the hearer, fully and clearly, the ideas and feelings of\\nthe writer.\\n\\nIn order to do this, it is necessary that a selection should be carefully\\nstudied by the pupil before he attempts to read it. In accordance with\\nthis view, a preliminary rule of importance is the following:\\n\\nRULE 1.--Before attempting to read a lesson, the learner should make\\nhimself fully acquainted with the subject as treated of in that lesson,\\nand endeavor to make the thought and feeling and sentiments of the writer\\nhis own.\\n\\nREMARK.--When he has thus identified himself with the author, he has the\\nsubstance of all rules in his own mind. It is by going to nature that we\\nfind rules. The child or the savage orator never mistakes in inflection or\\nemphasis or modulation. The best speakers and readers are those who follow\\nthe impulse of nature, or most closely imitate it as observed in others.\\n\\nII. ARTICULATION.\\n\\nArticulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and\\nof their combinations.\\n\\nAn Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of\\nspeech.\\n\\nThe Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,\\nSubvocals, and Aspirates.\\n\\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS.--VOCALS.\\n\\nVocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. A diphthong is a union\\nof two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other.\\n\\nDIRECTION.--Put the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper\\nposition; pronounce the word in the chart forcibly, and with the falling\\ninflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or\\naspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals\\nalone.\\n\\nTable of Vocals.\\n\\n            Long Vocals.\\nVocal   as in      Vocal   as in\\n-----   -----      -----   -----\\na       hate         e     err\\na       hare         i     pine\\na       far          o     no\\na       pass         u     tube\\na       fall         u     burn\\ne       eve         oo     cool\\n\\n            Short Vocals\\nVocal   as in      Vocal   as in\\n-----   -----      -----   -----\\na       mat          o     hot\\ne       met          u     us\\ni       it          oo     book\\n\\n\\n\\nDiphthongs.\\nVocal     as in\\n------   --------\\noi, oy   oil, boy\\nou, ow   out,now\\n\\nREMARK 1.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite\\nthe same in quality as certain of the long sounds. The difference consists\\nchiefly in quantity.\\n\\nREMARK 2. The vocals are often represented by other letters or\\ncombinations of letters than those used in the table; for instance, a is\\nrepresented by ai in hail, ea in steak, etc.\\n\\nREMARK 3.--As a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be\\narticulated with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a\\nsharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance.\\n\\n\\n\\nSUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.\\n\\nSubvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less\\nobstructed.\\n\\nAspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.\\n\\nWords ending with subvocal sounds should be selected for practice on the\\nsubvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for\\npractice on the aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly\\nseveral times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the\\nsubvocals and aspirates alone.

INFLECTIONS.\\n\\nInflections are slides of the voice upward or downward. Of these, there\\nare two: the rising inflection and the falling inflection.\\n\\nThe Rising Inflection is that in which the voice slides upward, and is\\nmarked thus (\\'); as,\\n\\n   Did you walk\\'? Did you walk.\\n\\nThe Falling Inflection is that in which the voice slides downward, and is\\nmarked thus (\\'); as,\\n\\n  I did not walk\\'. I did not walk.\\n\\nBoth inflections are exhibited in the following question:\\n\\n  Did you walk\\' or ride\\'? walk or ride.\\n\\nIn the following examples, the first member has the rising and the second\\nmember the falling inflection:\\n\\nEXAMPLES.[1]\\n\\n  Is he sick\\', or is he well\\'?\\n  Did you say valor\\', or value\\'?\\n  Did you say statute\\', or statue\\'?\\n  Did he act properly\\', or improperly\\'?\\n\\n[Footnote 1: These questions and similar ones, with their answers, should\\nbe repeatedly pronounced with their proper  inflection, until the\\ndistinction between the rising and falling inflection is well understood\\nand easily made by the learner. He will be assisted in this by\\nemphasizing strongly the word which receives the inflection, thus. Did\\nyou RIDE\\' or did you WALK\\'?]\\n\\nIn the following examples, the inflections are used in a contrary order,\\nthe first member terminating with the falling and the second with the\\nrising inflection:\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  He is well\\', not sick\\'.\\n  I said value\\', not valor\\'.\\n  I said statue\\', not statute\\'.\\n  He acted properly\\', not improperly\\'.\\n\\n\\nFALLING INFLECTIONS.\\n\\nRule VI.--The falling inflection is generally proper wherever the sense is\\ncomplete.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  Truth is more wonderful than fiction\\'.\\n  Men generally die as they live\\'.\\n  By industry we obtain wealth\\'.\\n\\n\\nREMARK.--Parts of a sentence often make complete sense in themselves, and\\nin this case, unless qualified or restrained by the succeeding clause, or\\nunless the contrary is indicated by some other principle, the falling\\ninflection takes place according to the rule.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES\\n\\n  Truth is wonderful\\', even more so than fiction\\'.\\n\\n  Men generally die as they live\\' and by their actions we must judge of\\n  their character\\'.\\n\\n\\nException.--When a sentence concludes with a negative clause, or with a\\ncontrast or comparison (called also antithesis), the first member of which\\nrequires the falling inflection, it must close with the rising inflection.\\n(See Rule XI, and paragraph 2, Note.)\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nNo one desires to be thought a fool\\'.\\n\\nI come to bury\\' Caesar, not to praise\\' him.\\n\\nHe lives in England\\' not in France\\'.\\n\\n\\nREMARK.--In bearing testimony to the general character of a man we say:\\n\\n  He is too honorable\\' to be guilty of a vile\\' act.\\n\\nBut if he is accused of some act of baseness, a contrast is at once\\ninstituted between his character and the specified act, and we change the\\ninflections, and say:\\n\\n  He is too honorable\\' to be guilty of such\\' an act.\\n\\nA man may say in general terms:\\n\\n  I am too busy\\' for projects\\'.\\n\\nBut if he is urged to embark in some particular enterprise, he will\\nchange the inflections, and say:\\n\\n  I am too busy\\' for projects\\'.\\n\\nIn such cases, as the falling inflection is required in the former part by\\nthe principle of contrast and emphasis (as will hereafter be more fully\\nexplained), the sentence necessarily closes with the rising inflection.\\nSometimes, also, emphasis alone seems to require the rising inflection on\\nthe concluding word. See exception to Rule VII.\\n\\n(5.-2.)\\n\\n\\nSTRONG EMPHASIS.\\n\\nRULE VII.--Language which demands strong emphasis generally requires the\\nfalling inflection.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n1. Command or urgent entreaty; as,\\n\\n  Begone\\',\\n  Run\\' to your houses, fall\\' upon your knees,\\n  Pray\\' to the Gods to intermit the plagues.\\n\\n  0, save\\' me, Hubert\\' save\\' me I My eyes are out\\n  Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.\\n\\n\\n2. Exclamation, especially when indicating strong emotion; as,\\n\\n  0, ye Gods\\'! ye Gods\\'! must I endure all this?\\n\\n  Hark\\'! Hark\\'! the horrid sound\\n  Hath raised up his head.\\n\\n\\nFor interrogatory exclamation, see Rule X, Remark.\\n\\n\\n\\nSERIES OF WORDS OR MEMBERS.\\n\\n3. A series of words or members, whether in the beginning or middle of a\\nsentence, if it does not conclude the sentence, is called a commencing\\nseries, and usually requires the rising inflection when not emphatic.\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF COMMENCING SERIES.\\n\\n  Wine\\', beauty\\', music\\', pomp\\', are poor expedients to heave off the load\\n  of an hour from the heir of eternity\\'.\\n\\n  I conjure you by that which you profess,\\n  (Howe\\'er you came to know it,) answer me;\\n  Though you untie the winds and let them fight\\n  Against the churches\\'; though the yeasty waves\\n  Confound and swallow navigation\\' up;\\n  Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down\\';\\n  Though castles topple on their warders\\' heads\\';\\n  Though palaces and pyramids do slope\\n  Their heads to their foundations\\'; though the treasures\\n  Of nature\\'s germens tumble altogether\\',\\n  Even till destruction sicken\\'; answer me\\n  To what I ask\\' you.\\n\\n\\n4. A series of words or members which concludes a sentence is called a\\nconcluding series, and each member usually has the falling inflection.\\n\\nEXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING SERIES.\\n\\nThey, through faith, subdued kingdoms\\', wrought righteousness\\' obtained\\npromises\\', stopped the mouths of lions\\', quenched the violence of fire\\',\\nescaped the edge of the sword\\', out of weakness were made strong\\', waxed\\nvaliant in fight\\', turned to flight the armies of the aliens\\'.\\n\\n\\nREMARK.--When the emphasis on these words or members is not marked, they\\ntake the rising inflection, according to Rule IX.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  They are the offspring of restlessness\\', vanity\\', and idleness\\'.\\n  Love\\', hope\\', and joy\\' took possession of his breast.\\n\\n5. When words which naturally take the rising inflection become emphatic\\nby repetition or any other cause, they often take the falling inflection.\\n\\nException to the Rule.--While the tendency of emphasis is decidedly to the\\nuse of the falling inflection, sometimes a word to which the falling\\ninflection naturally belongs changes this, when it is emphatic, for the\\nrising inflection.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  Three thousand ducats\\': \\'t is a good round sum\\'.\\n  It is useless to point out the beauties of nature to one who is blind\\'.\\n\\nHere sum and blind, according to Rule VI, would take the falling\\ninflection, but as they are emphatic, and the object of emphasis is to\\ndraw attention to the word emphasized, this is here accomplished in part\\nby giving an unusual inflection. Some speakers would give these words the\\ncircumflex, but it would he the rising circumflex, so that the sound would\\nstill terminate with the rising inflection.\\n\\nRULE VIII.--Questions which can not be answered by yes or no, together\\nwith their answers, generally require the falling inflection.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nWhere has he gone\\'?    Ans. To New York\\'.\\nWhat has he done\\'?     Ans. Nothing\\'.\\nWho did this\\'?         Ans. I know not\\'.\\nWhen did he go\\'?       Ans. Yesterday\\'.\\n\\n\\nREMARK.--It these questions are repeated, the inflection is changed\\naccording to the principle stated under the Exception to Rule VII.\\n\\n\\nRISING INFLECTION.\\n\\nRULE IX.--Where a pause is rendered proper by the meaning, and the sense\\nis incomplete, the rising inflection is generally required.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nTo endure slander and abuse with meekness\\' requires no ordinary degree of\\nself-command\\',\\n\\nNight coming on\\', both armies retired from the field of battle\\'.\\n\\nAs a dog returneth to his vomit\\', so a fool returneth to his folly\\'.\\n\\nREMARK.--The person or object addressed, in ordinary conversation, comes\\nunder this head.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nFathers\\'! we once again are met in council.\\n\\nMy lords\\'! and gentlemen\\'! we have arrived at an awful crisis.\\n\\nAge\\'! thou art shamed.\\n\\nRome\\'! thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\\n\\n\\nException.--Where a word which, according to this rule, requires the\\nrising inflection, becomes emphatic, it generally has the falling\\ninflec-tion; as, when a child addresses his father, he first says,\\nFather\\'! but if he repeats it emphatically, he changes the inflection, and\\nsays, Father\\'! Father\\'! The falling inflection is also used in formal\\naddress; as, Fellow--citizens\\', Mr. President\\', etc.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nWhen we aim at a high standard, if we do not attain\\' it, we shall secure a\\nhigh degree of excellence.\\n\\nThose who mingle with the vicious, if they do not become depraved\\', will\\nlose all delicacy of feeling.\\n\\nRULE X.--Questions which may be answered by yes or no, generally require\\nthe rising, and their answers the falling inflection.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nHas he arrived\\'? Yes\\'.\\nWill he return\\'? No\\'.\\nDoes the law condemn him\\'? It does not\\'.\\n\\nException.--If these questions are repeated emphatically, they take the\\nfalling inflection, according to Rule VII.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nHas he arrived\\'?\\nWill he return\\'?\\nDoes the law condemn him\\'?\\n\\nREMARK.--When a word or sentence is repeated as a kind of interrogatory\\nexclamation, the rising inflection is used according to the principles of\\nthis rule.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nYou ask, who would venture\\' in such a cause! Who would venture\\'? Rather\\nsay, who would not\\' venture all things for such an object!\\n\\nHe is called the friend\\' of virtue. The friend\\'! ay! the enthusiastic\\nlover\\' the devoted protector\\' rather.\\n\\nSo, also, when one receives unexpected information he exclaims, Ah\\'!\\nindeed\\'!\\n\\nREMARK.--In the above examples the words \"venture,\" \"friend,\" \"ah,\" etc.,\\nmay be considered as interrogatory exclamations, because if the sense were\\ncarried out it would be in the form of question; as, \"Do you ask who would\\nventure\\'?\" \"Do you say that he is the friend\\' of virtue?\" \"Is it\\npossible\\'?\" and thus they would receive the rising inflection according to\\nthis rule.\\n\\n\\n\\nRISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS.\\n\\nRULE XI.--The different members of a sentence expressing comparison, or\\ncontrast, or negation and affirmation, or where the parts are united by or\\nused disjunctively, require different inflections; generally the rising\\ninflection in the first member, and the falling inflection in the second\\nmember. This order is, however, sometimes inverted.\\n\\n1. Comparison and contrast. This is also called antithesis.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nIn all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God; by honor\\', and\\ndishonor\\'; by evil\\' report, and good\\' report; as deceivers\\', and yet\\ntrue\\'; as unknown\\', and yet well\\' known; as dying\\', and behold we live\\';\\nas chastened\\', and not killed\\'; as sorrowful\\', yet always rejoicing\\'; as\\npoor\\', yet making many rich\\'; as having nothing\\', yet possessing all\\'\\nthings.\\n\\nEurope was one great battlefield, where the weak struggled for freedom\\',\\nand the strong for dominion\\'. The king was without power\\', and the nobles\\nwithout principle\\', They were tyrants at home\\', and robbers abroad\\'.\\n\\n\\n2. Negation and affirmation.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  He desired not to injure\\' his friend, but to protect\\' him.\\n  We desire not your money\\', but yourselves\\'.\\n  I did not say a better\\' soldier, but, an elder\\'.\\n\\nIf the affirmative clause comes first, the order of the inflections is\\ninverted.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  He desired to protect\\' his friend, not to injure\\' him.\\n  We desire yourselves\\', not your money\\'.\\n  I said an elder\\' soldier, not a better\\'.\\n\\nThe affirmative clause is sometimes understood.\\n\\n  We desire not your money\\'.\\n  I did not say a better\\' soldier.\\n  The region beyond the grave is not a solitary\\' land.\\n\\n\\nIn most negative sentences standing alone, the corresponding affirmative\\nis understood; hence the following.\\n\\nREMARK.--Negative sentences, whether alone or connected with an\\naffirmative clause, generally end with the rising inflection.\\n\\n\\nIf such sentences are repeated emphatically, they take the falling\\ninflection according to Rule VI.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  We do not\\' desire your money.\\n  I did not\\' say a. better soldier.\\n\\n3. Or used disjunctively.\\n\\n  Did he behave properly\\', or improperly\\'?\\n\\n  Are they living/, or dead\\'?\\n\\n  Is he rich\\', or poor\\'?\\n\\n  Does God, having made his creatures, take no further\\' care of them, or\\n  does he preserve and guide them\\'?\\n\\nREMARK.--Where or is used conjunctively, this rule does not apply; as,\\nWill the law of kindness\\' or of justice\\' justify such conduct\\'?\\n\\n\\n\\nCIRCUMFLEX.\\n\\nThe circumflex is a union of the rising and falling inflections. Properly\\nspeaking, there are two of these, the one called the rising circumflex, in\\nwhich the voice slides down and then up; and the other, the falling\\ncircumflex, in which the voice slides upward and then downward on the same\\nvowel. They may both be denoted by the same mark, thus, (^). The\\ncircumflex is used chiefly to indicate the emphasis of irony, of contrast,\\nor of hypothesis.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n1. Queen. Hamlet, you have your father much offended.\\n   Hamlet. Madam, you have my father much offended.\\n\\n2. They offer us their protec\\'tion. Yes\\', such protection as vultures give\\n   to lambs, covering and devouring them.\\n\\n3. I knew when seven justices could not make up a quarrel; but when the\\nparties met themselves, one of them thought but of an if; as, If you said\\nso, then I said so; O ho! did you say so! So they shook hands and were\\nsworn brothers.\\n\\nREMARKS.--In the first example, the emphasis is that of contrast. The\\nqueen had poisoned her husband, of which she incorrectly supposed her son\\nignorant, and she blames him for treating his father-in-law with\\ndisrespect. In his reply, Hamlet contrasts her deep crime with his own\\nslight offense, and the circumflex upon \"you\" becomes proper.\\n\\nIn the second example the emphasis is ironical. The Spaniards pretended\\nthat they would protect the Peruvians if they would submit to them,\\nwhereas it was evident that they merely desired to plunder and destroy\\nthem. Thus their protection is ironically called \"such protection as\\nvultures give to lambs,\" etc.\\n\\nIn the third example, the word \"so\" is used hypothetically; that is, it\\nimplies a condition or supposition. It will be observed that the rising\\ncircumflex is used in the first \"so,\" and the falling, in the second,\\nbecause the first \"so\" must end with the rising inflection and the second\\nwith the falling inflection, according to previous rules.\\n\\n\\n\\nMONOTONE.\\n\\nWhen no word in a sentence receives an inflection, it is said to be read\\nin a monotone; that is, in nearly the same tone throughout. This\\nuniformity of tone is occa-sionally adopted, and is fitted to express\\nsolemnity or sublimity of idea, and sometimes intensity of feeling. It is\\nused, also, when the whole sentence or phrase is emphatic. In books of\\nelocution, when it is marked at all, it is generally marked thus (---), as\\nin the lines following.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nHence! loathed melancholy!\\nWhere brooding darkness spreads her jealous wings,\\nAnd the night raven sings;\\nThere, under ebon shades and low-browed rocks,\\nAs ragged as thy locks,\\nIn deep Cimmerian darkness ever dwell.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. ACCENT.\\n\\nIn every word which contains more than one syllable, one of the syllables\\nis pronounced with a somewhat greater stress of voice than the others.\\nThis syllable is said to be accented. The accented syllable is\\ndistinguished by this mark (\\'), the same which is used in inflections.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n      Love\\'ly,      re-turn\\',      re-mem\\'ber,\\n      Con\\'stant,    re-main\\',      a-sun\\'der,\\n      Mem\\'ber,      a-bide\\',       a-ban\\'don,\\n      Win\\'dow,      a-tone\\',       rec-ol-lect\\',\\n      Ban\\'ner,      a-lone\\',       re-em-bark\\',\\n\\nREMARK.--In most cases custom is the only guide for placing the accent on\\none syllable rather than another. Sometimes, however, the same word is\\ndifferently accented in order to mark its different meanings.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nCon\\'jure, to practice enchantments.     Con-jure\\', to entreat.\\nGal\\'lant, brave.                        Gal-lant\\', a gay fellow.\\nAu\\'gust, a month.                       Au-gust\\', grand.\\n\\nREMARK.--A number of words used sometimes as one part of speech, and\\nsometimes as another, vary their accents irregularly.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nPres\\'ent, noun.     Pres\\'ent, adjective.       Pre-sent\\', verb.\\nCom\\'pact, noun.     Com-pact\\', adjective.      Com-pact\\', verb.\\n\\nIn words of more than two syllables there is often a second accent given,\\nbut more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary\\naccent; as, car\\'a-van\\'\\', rep\\'\\'ar-tee\\', where the principal accent is\\nmarked (\\') and the secondary (\\'\\'); so, also, this accent is obvious in\\nnav\\'\\'-i-ga\\'tion, com\\'\\'pre-hen\\'sion, plau\\'\\'si-bil\\'i-ty, etc. The whole\\nsubject, however, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.\\n\\n\\n\\nV. EMPHASIS.\\n\\nA word is said to be emphasized when it is uttered with a greater stress\\nof voice than the other words with which it is connected.\\n\\nREMARK 1.--The object of emphasis is to attract particular attention to\\nthe word upon which it is placed, indicating that the idea to be conveyed\\ndepends very much upon that word. This object, as just stated, is\\ngenerally accomplished by increasing the force of utterance, but\\nsometimes, also, by a change in the inflection, by the use of the\\nmonotone, by pause, or by uttering the words in a very low key. Emphatic\\nwords are often denoted by italics, and a still stronger emphasis by SMALL\\nCAPITALS or CAPITALS, according to the degree of emphasis desired.\\n\\nREMARK 2.--Emphasis constitutes the most important feature in reading and\\nspeaking, and, properly applied, gives life and character to language.\\nAccent, inflection, and indeed everything yields to emphasis.\\n\\nREMARK 3.--In the following examples it will be seen that accent is\\ngoverned by it.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  What is done cannot be undone.\\n  There is a difference between giving and forgiving.\\n  He that descended is the same that ascended.\\n\\nSome appear to make very little difference between decency and indecency,\\nmorality and immorality, religion and irreligion.\\n\\nREMARK 4.--There is no better illustration of the nature and importance of\\nemphasis than the following examples. It will he observed that the meaning\\nand proper answer of the question vary with each change of the emphasis.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nQUESTIONS.                               ANSWERS.\\n---------                                --------\\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, my brother went.\\n\\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I rode.\\n\\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I went into the country.\\n\\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I went the day before.\\n\\n\\n\\nABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.\\n\\nSometimes a word is emphasized simply to indicate the importance of the\\nidea. This is called absolute emphasis.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!\\n  Woe unto you, PHARISEES! HYPOCRITES!\\n  Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away.\\n\\nREMARK.--In instances like the last, it is sometimes called the emphasis\\nof specification.\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATIVE EMPHASIS.\\n\\nWords are often emphasized in order to exhibit the idea they express as\\ncompared or contrasted with some other idea. This is called relative\\nemphasis.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nA friend can not be known in prosperity; an enemy can not be hidden in\\nadversity.\\n\\nIt is much better to be injured than to injure.\\n\\nREMARK.--In many instances one part only of the antithesis is expressed,\\nthe corresponding idea being understood; as,\\n\\n            A friendly eye would never see such faults.\\n\\nHere the unfriendly eye is understood.\\n\\nKing Henry exclaims, while vainly endeavoring to compose\\nhimself to rest,\\n\\n  \"How many thousand of my poorest subjects\\n  Are at this hour asleep!\"\\n\\nHere the emphatic words thousand, subjects, and asleep are contrasted in\\nidea with their opposites, and if the contrasted ideas were expressed it\\nmight be in this way:\\n\\n  While I alone, their sovereign, am doomed to wakefulness.\\n\\n\\n\\nEMPHATIC PHRASE.\\n\\nSometimes several words in succession are emphasized, forming what is\\ncalled an emphatic phrase.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nShall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine\\nnations but of the Alps themselves--shall I compare myself with this\\nHALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?\\n\\nShall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the LAST TEN\\nYEARS.\\n\\n  And if thou said\\'st I am not peer\\n  To any lord in Scotland here,\\n  Lowland or Highland, far or near,\\n  Lord Angus-THOU-HAST-LIED!\\n\\nEMPHATIC PAUSE.\\n\\nThe emphatic expression of a sentence often requires a pause where the\\ngrammatical construction authorizes none. This is sometimes called the\\nrhetorical pause. Such pauses occur chiefly before or after an emphatic\\nword or phrase, and sometimes both before and after it.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nRise--fellow-men! our country--yet remains!\\nBy that dread name we wave the sword on high,\\nAnd swear for her--to live--with her--to die.\\n\\nBut most--by numbers judge the poet\\'s song:\\nAnd smooth or rough, with them is--right or wrong.\\n\\nHe said; then full before their sight\\nProduced the beast, and lo!--\\'t was white.\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. MODULATION.\\n\\nModulation includes the variations of the voice. These may be classed\\nunder the heads of Pitch, Compass, Quantity, and Quality.\\n\\nPITCH AND COMPASS.\\n\\nIf anyone will notice closely a sentence as uttered in private\\nconversation, he will observe that very few successive words are\\npronounced in exactly the same key or with the same force. At the same\\ntime, however, there is a certain PITCH or key, which seems, on the whole,\\nto prevail.\\n\\nThis keynote, or governing note, as it may be called, is that upon which\\nthe voice most frequently dwells, to which it usually returns when\\nwearied, and upon which a sentence generally commences, and very\\nfrequently ends, while, at the same time, there is a considerable play of\\nthe voice above and below it.\\n\\nThis key may be high or low. It varies in different individuals, and at\\ndifferent times in the same individual, being governed by the nature of\\nthe subject and the emotions of the speaker. It is worthy of notice,\\nhowever, that most speakers pitch their voices on a key too high.\\n\\nThe range of the voice above and below this note is called its COMPASS.\\nWhen the speaker is animated, this range is great; but upon abstract\\nsubjects, or with a dull speaker, it is small. If, in reading or speaking,\\ntoo high a note be chosen, the lungs will soon become wearied; if too low\\na pitch be selected, there is danger of indistinctness of utterance; and\\nin either case there is less room for compass or variety of tone than if\\none be taken between the two extremes.\\n\\nTo secure the proper pitch and the greatest compass observe the following\\nrule:\\n\\nRULE XII.--The reader or speaker should choose that pitch in which he can\\nfeel himself most at ease, and above and below which he may have most room\\nfor variation.\\n\\nREMARK 1.--Having chosen the proper keynote, he should beware of confining\\nhimself to it. This constitutes monotony, one of the greatest faults in\\nelocution. One very important instrument for giving expression and life to\\nthought is thus lost, and the hearer soon becomes wearied and disgusted.\\n\\nREMARK 2.--There is another fault of nearly equal magnitude, and of very\\nfrequent occurrence. This consists in varying the pitch and force without\\nreference to the sense. A sentence is commenced with vehemence and in a\\nhigh key, and the voice gradually sinks until, the breath being spent, it\\ndies away in a whisper.\\n\\nNOTE--The power of changing the key at will is difficult to acquire, but\\nof great importance.\\n\\nREMARK 3.--The habit of singsong, so common in reading poetry, as it is a\\nvariation of pitch without reference to the sense, is a species of the\\nfault above mentioned.\\n\\nREMARK 4.--If the reader or speaker is guided by the sense, and if he\\ngives that emphasis, inflection, and expression required by the meaning,\\nthese faults speedily disappear.\\n\\nREMARK 5.--To improve the voice in these respects, practice is necessary.\\nCommence, for example, with the lowest pitch the voice can comfortably\\nsound, and repeat whole paragraphs and pages upon that key with gentle\\nforce. Then repeat the paragraph with increased force, taking care not to\\nraise the pitch. Then rise one note higher, and practice on that, then\\nanother, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice is reached.\\nReverse the process, and repeat as before until the lowest pitch is\\nobtained.\\n\\nNOTE.--In these and all similar exercises, be very careful not to\\nconfound pitch and force.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUANTITY AND QUALITY.\\n\\nThe tones of the voice should vary also in quantity, or time required to\\nutter a sound or a syllable, and in quality, or expression, according to\\nthe nature of the subject.\\n\\nREMARK.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of\\npersuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh,\\nirregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the\\nplaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow\\nof words in argumentative style.\\n\\nThe following direction, therefore, is worthy of attention:\\n\\nThe tones of the voice should always correspond both in quantity and\\nquality with the nature of the subject.\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\nPassion and Grief\\n\\n   \"Come back! come back!\" he cried, in grief.\\n   \"Across this stormy water,\\n   And I\\'ll forgive your Highland chief,\\n      My daughter! O, my daughter!\"\\n\\n\\nPlaintive\\n  I have lived long enough: my way of life\\n  Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:\\n  And that which should accompany old age,\\n  As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\\n  I must not look to have.\\n\\n\\nCalm\\n   A very great portion of this globe is covered  with water, which is\\n   called sea, and is very distinct from rivers and lakes.\\n\\n\\nFierce Anger\\n\\n  Burned Marmion\\'s swarthy cheek like fire,\\n  And shook his very frame for ire,\\n        And--\"This to me?\" he said;\\n     \"And \\'t were not for thy hoary beard,\\n  Such hand as Marmion\\'s had not spared\\n     To cleave the Douglas\\' head!\\n\\n\\nLoud and Explosive\\n\\n     \"Even in thy pitch of pride,\\n  Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,\\n      I tell thee thou \\'rt defied!\\n  And if thou said\\'st I am not peer\\n  To any lord in Scotland here,\\n  Lowland or Highland, far or near,\\n  Lord Angus, thou hast lied \\'\"\\n\\n\\nREMARK 1.--In our attempt to imitate nature it is important to avoid\\naffectation, for to this fault even perfect monotony is preferable.\\n\\nREMARK 2.--The strength of the voice may be increased by practicing with\\ndifferent degrees of loudness, from a whisper to full rotundity, taking\\ncare to keep the voice on the same key. The same note in music may be\\nsounded loud or soft. So also a sentence may be pronounced on the same\\npitch with different degrees of loudness. Having practiced with different\\ndegrees of loudness on one key, make the same experiment on another, and\\nthen on another, and so on. This will also give the learner practice in\\ncompass,\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. POETIC PAUSES.\\n\\nIn poetry we have, in addition to other pauses, poetic pauses. The object\\nof these is simply to promote the melody.\\n\\nAt the end of each line a slight pause is proper, whatever be the\\ngrammatical construction or the sense. The purpose of this pause is to\\nmake prominent the melody of the measure, and in rhyme to allow the ear to\\nappreciate the harmony of the similar sounds.\\n\\nThere is, also, another important pause, somewhere near the middle of each\\nline, which is called the caesura or caesural pause. In the following\\nlines it is marked thus (||):\\n\\nEXAMPLES.\\n\\n  There are hours long departed || which memory brings,\\n    Like blossoms of Eden || to twine round the heart,\\n  And as time rushes by || on the might of his wings,\\n    They may darken awhile || but they never depart.\\n\\nREMARK.--The caesural pause should never be so placed as to injure the\\nsense. The following lines, if melody alone were consulted, would be read\\nthus:\\n\\n  With fruitless la || bor Clara bound,\\n  And strove to stanch || the gushing wound;\\n  The Monk with un || availing cares,\\n  Exhausted all || the church\\'s prayers.\\n\\nThis manner of reading, however, would very much interfere with the proper\\nexpression of the idea. This is to be corrected by making the caesural\\npause yield to the sense. The above lines should be read thus:\\n\\n  With fruitless labor || Clara bound,\\n  And strove || to stanch the gushing wound;\\n  The Monk || with unavailing cares,\\n  Exhausted || all the church\\'s prayers,\\n\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES.\\n\\nI. DEATH OF FRANKLIN.\\n(To be read in a solemn tone.)\\n\\nFranklin is dead. The genius who freed America\\', and poured a\\ncopious stream of knowledge throughout Europe\\', is returned unto the bosom\\nof the Divinity\\'. The sage to whom two worlds\\' lay claim, the man for whom\\nscience\\' and politics\\' are disputing, indisputably enjoyed au elevated\\nrank in human nature.\\n\\nThe cabinets of princes have been long in the habit of notifying the death\\nof those who were great\\', only in their funeral orations\\'.

The representatives\\'\\nof nations should recommend to public homage\\' only those who have been the\\nheroes of humanity\\'.\\n\\n\\nII. BONAPARTE.\\n\\nHe knew no motive\\' but interst\\'; acknowledged no criterion\\' but success\\';\\nhe worshiped no God\\' but ambition\\'; and with an eastern devotion\\', he\\nknelt at the shrine of his idolatry\\'. Subsidiary to this, there was no\\ncreed\\' that he did not profess\\'; there was no opinion\\' that he did not\\npromulgate\\': in the hope of a dynasty\\', he upheld the crescent\\'; for the\\nsake of a divorce\\', he bowed before the cross\\'; the orphan of St. Louis\\',\\nhe became the adopted child of the republic\\'; and, with a parricidal\\ningrati-tude\\', on the ruins both of the throne and the tribune, he reared\\nthe throne of his despotism\\'.\\n\\nAt his touch crowns\\' crumbled\\'; beggars\\' reigned\\'; systems\\' van-ished\\';\\nthe wildest theories\\' took the color of his whim\\'; and all that was\\nvenerable\\' and all that was novel\\', changed places with the rapidity of a\\ndrama\\'. Nature had no obstacle\\' that he did not surmount\\'; space, no\\nopposition\\' he did not spurn\\'; and whether amid Alpine rocks\\',--Arabian\\nsands\\',--or Polar snows\\',---he seemed proof\\' against peril\\', and empowered\\nwith ubiquity\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.

It is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, that, as he was\\nseated one day in his private room, a written petition was brought to him\\nwith the request that it should be immediately read.  The King had just\\nreturned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some other cause, had\\nso dazzled his eyes that he found it difficult to make out a single word\\nof the writing.\\n\\n2. His private secretary happened to be absent; and the soldier who\\nbrought the petition could not read. There was a page, or favorite boy\\nservant, waiting in the hall, and upon him the King called. The page was a\\nson of one of the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor\\nreader.\\n\\n3. In the first place, he did not articulate distinctly. He huddled his\\nwords together in the utterance, as if they were syllables of one long\\nword, which he must get through with as speedily as possible. His\\npronunciation was bad, and he did not modulate his voice so as to bring\\nout the meaning of what he read. Every sentence was uttered with a dismal\\nmonotony of voice, as if it did not differ in any respect from that which\\npreceded it.\\n\\n4. \"Stop!\" said the King, impatiently. \"Is it an auctioneer\\'s list of\\ngoods to be sold that you are hurrying over? Send your companion to me.\"\\nAnother page who stood at the door now entered, and to him the King gave\\nthe petition. The second page began by hemming and clearing his throat in\\nsuch an affected manner that the King jokingly asked him whether he had\\nnot slept in the public garden, with the gate open, the night before.\\n\\n5. The second page had a good share of self-conceit, however, and so was\\nnot greatly confused by the King\\'s jest. He determined that he would avoid\\nthe mistake which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading the\\npetition slowly and with great formality, emphasizing every word, and\\nprolonging the articulation of every syllable. But his manner was so\\ntedious that the King cried out, \"Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the\\nelementary sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send me that little girl\\nwho is sitting there by the fountain.\"\\n\\n6. The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daughter of one of the\\nlaborers employed by the royal gardener; and she had come to help her\\nfather weed the flower beds. It chanced that, like many of the poor people\\nin Prussia, she had received a good education. She was somewhat alarmed\\nwhen she found herself in the King\\'s presence, but took courage when the\\nKing told her that he only wanted her to read for him, as his eyes were\\nweak.\\n\\n7. Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little girl) was fond of\\nreading aloud, and often many of the neighbors would assemble at her\\nfather\\'s house to hear her; those who could not read themselves would come\\nto her, also, with their letters from distant friends or children, and she\\nthus formed the habit of reading various sorts of handwriting promptly and\\nwell.\\n\\n8. The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly glanced through the\\nopening lines to get some idea of what it was about. As she read, her eyes\\nbegan to glisten, and her breast to heave. \"What is the matter?\" asked the\\nKing; \"don\\'t you know how to read?\" \"Oh, yes! sire,\" she replied,\\naddressing him with the title usually applied to him: \"I will now read it,\\nif you please.\"\\n\\n9. The two pages wore about to leave the room. \"Remain,\" said the King.\\nThe little girl began to read the petition. It was from a poor widow,\\nwhose only son had been drafted to serve in the army, although his health\\nwas delicate and his pursuits had been such as to unfit him for military\\nlife. His father had been killed in battle, and the son had a strong\\ndesire to become a portrait painter.\\n\\n10. The writer told her story in a simple, concise manner, that carried to\\nthe heart a belief of its truth; and Ernestine read it with so much\\nfeeling, and with an articulation so just, in tones so pure and distinct,\\nthat when she had finished, the King, into whose eyes the tears had\\nstarted, exclaimed, \"Oh! now I understand what it is all about; but I\\nmight never have known, certainly I never should have felt, its meaning\\nhad I trusted to these young gentlemen, whom I now dismiss from my service\\nfor one year, advising them to occupy their time in learning to read.\"\\n\\n11. \"As for you, my young lady,\" continued the King, \"I know you will ask\\nno better reward for your trouble than the pleasure of carrying to this\\npoor widow my order for her son\\'s immediate discharge. Let me see whether\\nyou can write as well as you can read. Take this pen, and write as I\\ndictate.\" He then dictated an order, which Ernestine wrote, and he signed.\\nCalling one of his guards, he bade him go with the girl and see that the\\norder was obeyed.\\n\\n12. How much happiness was Ernestine the means of bestowing through her\\ngood elocution, united to the happy circumstance that brought it to the\\nknowledge of the King! First, there were her poor neighbors, to whom she\\ncould give instruction and entertainment. Then, there was the poor widow\\nwho sent the petition, and who not only regained her son, but received\\nthrough Ernestine an order for him to paint the King\\'s likeness; so that\\nthe poor boy soon rose to great distinction, and had more orders than he\\ncould attend to. Words could not express his gratitude, and that of his\\nmother, to the little girl.\\n\\n13. And Ernestine had, moreover, the satisfaction of aiding her father to\\nrise in the world, so that he became the King\\'s chief gardener.

He was\\ndistinguished for his military exploits, for his wise and just government,\\nand for his literary attainments. He wrote many able works in the French\\nlanguage. Many pleasant anecdotes are told of this king, of which the one\\ngiven in the lesson is a fair sample.\\n\\n\\n\\nII. THE BLUEBELL.\\n\\n1.  There is a story I have heard--\\n    A poet learned it of a bird,\\n    And kept its music every word--\\n\\n2.  A story of a dim ravine,\\n    O\\'er which the towering tree tops lean,\\n    With one blue rift of sky between;\\n\\n3.  And there, two thousand years ago,\\n    A little flower as white as snow\\n    Swayed in the silence to and fro.\\n\\n4.  Day after day, with longing eye,\\n    The floweret watched the narrow sky,\\n    And fleecy clouds that floated by.\\n\\n5.  And through the darkness, night by night,\\n    One gleaming star would climb the height,\\n    And cheer the lonely floweret\\'s sight.\\n\\n6.  Thus, watching the blue heavens afar,\\n    And the rising of its favorite star,\\n    A slow change came--but not to mar;\\n\\n7.  For softly o\\'er its petals white\\n    There crept a blueness, like the light\\n    Of skies upon a summer night;\\n\\n8.  And in its chalice, I am told,\\n    The bonny bell was formed to hold\\n    A tiny star that gleamed like gold.\\n\\n9.  Now, little people, sweet and true,\\n    I find a lesson here for you\\n    Writ in the floweret\\'s hell of blue:\\n\\n10. The patient child whose watchful eye\\n    Strives after all things pure and high,\\n    Shall take their image by and by.\\n\\n\\n DEFINITIONS.--2. Rift, a narrow opening, a cleft. 3. Swayed, swung. 5.\\n Height (pro. hite), an elevated place. 7. Pet\\'als, the colored leaves of\\n a flower. 8. Chal\\'ice, a cup or bowl. Bon\\'ny, beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. THE GENTLE HAND.\\n\\nTimothy S. Arthur (b. 1809, d. 1885) was born near Newburgh, N.Y., but\\npassed most of his life at Baltimore and Philadelphia. His opportunities\\nfor good schooling were quite limited, and he may be considered a\\nself-educated man. He was the author of more than a hundred volumes,\\nprincipally novels of a domestic and moral tone, and of many shorter\\ntales--magazine articles, etc. \"Ten Nights in a Barroom,\" and \"Three Years\\nin a Mantrap,\" are among his best known works.\\n\\n1. When and where it matters not now to relate--but once upon a time, as I\\nwas passing through a thinly peopled district of country, night came down\\nupon me almost unawares. Being on foot, I could not hope to gain the\\nvillage toward which my steps were directed, until a late hour; and I\\ntherefore preferred seeking shelter and a night\\'s lodging at the first\\nhumble dwelling that presented itself.\\n\\n2. Dusky twilight was giving place to deeper shadows, when I found myself\\nin the vicinity of a dwelling, from the small uncurtained windows of which\\nthe light shone with a pleasant promise of good cheer and comfort. The\\nhouse stood within an inclosure, and a short distance from the road along\\nwhich I was moving with wearied feet.\\n\\n3. Turning aside, and passing through the ill-hung gate, I approached the\\ndwelling. Slowly the gate swung on its wooden hinges, and the rattle of\\nits latch, in closing, did not disturb the air until I had nearly reached\\nthe porch in front of the house, in which a slender girl, who had noticed\\nmy entrance, stood awaiting my arrival.\\n\\n4. A deep, quick bark answered, almost like an echo, the sound of the\\nshutting gate, and, sudden as an apparition, the form of an immense dog\\nloomed in the doorway. At the instant when he was about to spring, a light\\nhand was laid upon his shaggy neck, and a low word spoken.\\n\\n5. \"Go in, Tiger,\" said the girl, not in a voice of authority, yet in her\\ngentle tones was the consciousness that she would be obeyed; and, as she\\nspoke, she lightly bore upon the animal with her hand, and he turned away\\nand disappeared within the dwelling.\\n\\n6. \"Who\\'s that?\" A rough voice asked the question; and now a heavy-looking\\nman took the dog\\'s place in the door.\\n\\n7. \"How far is it to G--?\" I asked, not deeming it best to say, in the\\nbeginning, that I sought a resting place for the night.\\n\\n8. \"To G--!\" growled the man, but not so harshly as at first. \"It\\'s good\\nsix miles from here.\"\\n\\n9. \"A long distance; and I\\'m a stranger and on foot,\" said I. \"If you can\\nmake room for me until morning, I will be very thankful.\"\\n\\n10. I saw the girl\\'s hand move quickly up his arm, until it rested on his\\nshoulder, and now she leaned to him still closer.\\n\\n11. \"Come in. We\\'ll try what can be done for you.\" There was a change in\\nthe man\\'s voice that made me wonder. I entered a large room, in which\\nblazed a brisk fire. Before the fire sat two stout lads, who turned upon\\nme their heavy eyes, with no very welcome greeting. A middle-aged woman\\nwas standing at a table, and two children were amusing themselves with a\\nkitten on the floor.\\n\\n12. \"A stranger, mother,\" said the man who had given me so rude a greeting\\nat the door; \"and he wants us to let him stay all night.\"\\n\\n13. The woman looked at me doubtingly for a few moments, and then replied\\ncoldly, \"We don\\'t keep a public house.\"\\n\\n14. \"I\\'m aware of that, ma\\'am,\" said I; \"but night has overtaken me, and\\nit\\'s a long way yet to G--.\"\\n\\n15. \"Too far for a tired man to go on foot,\" said the master of the house,\\nkindly, \"so it\\'s no use talking about it, mother; we must give him a bed.\"\\n\\n\\n16. So unobtrusively that I scarce noticed the movement, the girl had\\ndrawn to her mother\\'s side. What she said to her I did not hear, for the\\nbrief words were uttered in a low voice; but I noticed, as she spoke, one\\nsmall, fair hand rested on the woman\\'s hand.\\n\\n17. Was there magic in that touch? The woman\\'s repulsive aspect changed\\ninto one of kindly welcome, and she said, \"Yes, it\\'s a long way to G--. I\\nguess we can find a place for him.\"\\n\\n18. Many times more during that evening, did I observe the magic power of\\nthat hand and voice--the one gentle yet potent as the other. On the next\\nmorning, breakfast being over, I was preparing to take my departure when\\nmy host informed me that if I would wait for half an hour he would give me\\na ride in his wagon to G--, as business required him to go there. I was\\nvery well pleased to accept of the invitation.\\n\\n19. In due time, the farmer\\'s wagon was driven into the road before the\\nhouse, and I was invited to get in. I noticed the horse as a rough-looking\\nCanadian pony, with a certain air of stubborn endurance. As the farmer\\ntook his seat by my side, the family came to the door to see us off.\\n\\n20. \"Dick!\" said the farmer in a peremptory voice, giving the rein a quick\\njerk as he spoke. But Dick moved not a step. \"Dick! you vagabond! get up.\"\\nAnd the farmer\\'s whip cracked sharply by the pony\\'s ear.\\n\\n21. It availed not, however, this second appeal. Dick stood firmly\\ndisobedient. Next the whip was brought down upon him with an impatient\\nhand; but the pony only reared up a little. Fast and sharp the strokes\\nwere next dealt to the number of half a dozen. The man might as well have\\nbeaten the wagon, for all his end was gained.\\n\\n22. A stout lad now came out into the road, and, catching Dick by the\\nbridle, jerked him forward, using, at the same time, the customary\\nlanguage on such occasions, but Dick met this new ally with increased\\nstubbornness, planting his fore feet more firmly and at a sharper angle\\nwith the ground.\\n\\n23. The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side of the head with his\\nclinched hand, and jerked cruelly at his bridle. It availed nothing,\\nhowever; Dick was not to be wrought upon by any such arguments.\\n\\n24. \"Don\\'t do so, John!\" I turned my head as the maiden\\'s sweet voice\\nreached my ear. She was passing through the gate into the road, and in the\\nnext moment had taken hold of the lad and drawn him away from the animal.\\nNo strength was exerted in this; she took hold of his arm, and he obeyed\\nher wish as readily as if he had no thought beyond her gratification.\\n\\n25. And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony\\'s neck, and a\\nsingle low word spoken. How instantly were the tense muscles relaxed--how\\nquickly the stubborn air vanished!\\n\\n26. \"Poor Dick!\" said the maiden, as she stroked his neck lightly, or\\nsoftly patted it with a childlike hand. \"Now, go along, you provoking\\nfellow!\" she added, in a half-chiding, yet affectionate voice, as she drew\\nup the bridle.\\n\\n27. The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head against her arm for an\\ninstant or two; then, pricking up his ears, he started off at a light,\\ncheerful trot, and went on his way as freely as if no silly crotchet had\\never entered his stubborn brain.\\n\\n28. \"What a wonderful power that hand possesses!\" said I, speaking to my\\ncompanion, as we rode away.\\n\\n29. He looked at me for a moment, as if my remark had occasioned surprise.\\nThen a light came into his countenance, and he said briefly, \"She\\'s good!\\nEverybody and everything loves her.\"\\n\\n30. Was that, indeed, the secret of her power? Was the quality of her soul\\nperceived in the impression of her hand, even by brute beasts! The\\nfather\\'s explanation was doubtless the true one. Yet have I ever since\\nwondered, and still do wonder, at the potency which lay in that maiden\\'s\\nmagic touch. I have seen something of the same power, showing itself in\\nthe loving and the good, but never to the extent as instanced in her,\\nwhom, for want of a better name, I must still call \"Gentle Hand.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

Eastman (b. 1816, d.1861) was born in Maine, but removed at an\\nearly age to Vermont, where he was connected with the press at Burlington,\\nWoodstock, and Montpelier. He published a volume of poems in 1848, written\\nin a happy lyric and ballad style, and faithfully portraying rural life in\\nNew England.\\n\\n1. The farmer sat in his easy-chair\\n     Smoking his pipe of clay,\\n   While his hale old wife with busy care,\\n     Was clearing the dinner away;\\n   A sweet little girl with fine blue eyes,\\n   On her grandfather\\'s knee, was catching flies.\\n\\n2. The old man laid his hand on her head,\\n     With a tear on his wrinkled face,\\n   He thought how often her mother, dead,\\n     Had sat in the selfsame place;\\n   As the tear stole down from his half-shut eye,\\n   \"Don\\'t smoke!\" said the child, \"how it makes you cry!\"\\n\\n3. The house dog lay stretched out on the floor,\\n     Where the shade, afternoons, used to steal;\\n   The busy old wife by the open door\\n     Was turning the spinning wheel,\\n   And the old brass clock on the manteltree\\n   Had plodded along to almost three.\\n\\n4. Still the farmer sat in his easy-chair,\\n     While close to his heaving breast\\n   The moistened brow and the cheek so fair\\n     Of his sweet grandchild were pressed;\\n   His head bent down, all her soft hair lay;\\n   Fast asleep were they both on that summer day.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Hale, healthy. 3. Man\\'tel-tree, shelf over a fireplace.\\nPlod\\'ded, went slowly. 4. Heaving, rising and falling.\\n\\n\\n\\nV. A BOY ON A FARM.\\n\\nCharles Dudley Warner (b. 1829,--) was born at Plainfield, Mass. In 1851\\nhe graduated at Hamilton College, and in 1856 was admitted to the bar at\\nPhiladelphia, but moved to Chicago to practice his profession. There he\\nremained until 1860, when he became connected with the press at Hartford,\\nConn., and has ever since devoted himself to literature. \"My Summer in a\\nGarden,\" \"Saunterings,\" and \"Backlog Studies\" are his best known works.\\nThe following extract is from \"Being a Boy.\"\\n\\n1. Say what you will about the general usefulness of boys, it is my\\nimpression that a farm without a boy would very soon come to grief. What\\nthe boy does is the life of the farm. He is the factotum, always in\\ndemand, always expected to do the thousand indispensable things that\\nnobody else will do. Upon him fall all the odds and ends, the most\\ndifficult things.\\n\\n2. After everybody else is through, he has to finish up. His work is like\\na woman\\'s,--perpetually waiting on others. Everybody knows how much easier\\nit is to eat a good dinner than it is to wash the dishes afterwards.\\nConsider what a boy on a farm is required to do,--things that must be\\ndone, or life would actually stop.\\n\\n3. It is understood, in the first place, that he is to do all the errands,\\nto go to the store, to the post office, and to carry all sorts of\\nmessages. If he had as many legs as a centiped, they would tire before\\nnight. His two short limbs seem to him entirely inadequate to the task. He\\nwould like to have as many legs as a wheel has spokes, and rotate about in\\nthe same way.\\n\\n4. This he sometimes tries to do; and the people who have seen him\\n\"turning cart wheels\" along the side of the road, have supposed that he\\nwas amusing himself and idling his time; he was only trying to invent a\\nnew mode of locomotion, so that he could economize his legs, and do his\\nerrands with greater dispatch.\\n\\n5. He practices standing on his head, in order to accustom himself to any\\nposition. Leapfrog is one of his methods of getting over the ground\\nquickly. He would willingly go an errand any distance if he could leapfrog\\nit with a few other boys.\\n\\n6. He has a natural genius for combining pleasure with business. This is\\nthe reason why, when he is sent to the spring for a pitcher of water, he\\nis absent so long; for he stops to poke the frog that sits on the stone,\\nor, if there is a penstock, to put his hand over the spout, and squirt the\\nwater a little while.\\n\\n7. He is the one who spreads the grass when the men have cut it; he mows\\nit away in the barn; he rides the horse, to cultivate the corn, up and\\ndown the hot, weary rows; he picks up the potatoes when they are dug; he\\ndrives the cows night and morning; he brings wood and water, and splits\\nkindling; he gets up the horse, and puts out the horse; whether he is in\\nthe house or out of it, there is always something for him to do.\\n\\n8. Just before the school in winter he shovels paths; in summer he turns\\nthe grindstone. He knows where there are lots of wintergreens and sweet\\nflags, but instead of going for them, he is to stay indoors and pare\\napples, and stone raisins, and pound something in a mortar. And yet, with\\nhis mind full of schemes of what he would like to do, and his hands full\\nof occupations, he is an idle boy, who has nothing to busy himself with\\nbut school and chores!\\n\\n9. He would gladly do all the work if somebody else would do the chores,\\nhe thinks; and yet I doubt if any boy ever amounted to anything in the\\nworld, or was of much use as a man, who did not enjoy the advantages of a\\nliberal education in the way of chores.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Fac-to\\'tum, a person employed to do all kinds of work.\\nIn-dis-pen\\'sa-ble, absolutely necessary. 2. Per-pet\\'u-al-ly, continually.\\n3. Cen\\'ti-ped, an insect with a great number of feet. 4. E-con\\'o-mize, to\\nsave. Dis-patch\\', diligence, haste. 6. Pen\\'-stock, a wooden tube for\\nconducting water. 8. Chores, the light work of the household either within\\nor without doors.\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. THE SINGING LESSON.\\n\\nJean Ingelow (b. 1830, d.1897) was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, England.\\nHer fame as a poetess was at once established upon the publication of her\\n\"Poems\" in 1863; since which time several other volumes have appeared. The\\nmost generally admired of her poems are \"Songs of Seven\" and \"The High\\nTide on the Coast of Lincolnshire,\" She has also written several\\nsuccessful novels, of which, \"Off the Skelligs\" is the most popular.\\n\"Stories Told to a Child,\" \"The Cumberers,\" \"Poor Mat,\" \"Studies for\\nStories,\" and \"Mopsa, the Fairy\" are also well known. Miss Ingelow resided\\nin London, England, and spent much of her time in deeds of charity.\\n\\n1. A nightingale made a mistake;\\n     She sang a few notes out of tune:\\n   Her heart was ready to break,\\n     And she hid away from the moon.\\n   She wrung her claws, poor thing,\\n     But was far too proud to weep;\\n   She tucked her head under her wing,\\n     And pretended to be asleep.\\n\\n2. A lark, arm in arm with a thrush,\\n     Came sauntering up to the place;\\n   The nightingale felt herself blush,\\n     Though feathers hid her face;\\n   She knew they had heard her song,\\n     She felt them snicker and sneer;\\n   She thought that life was too long,\\n     And wished she could skip a year.\\n\\n3. \"O nightingale!\" cooed a dove;\\n     \"O nightingale! what\\'s the use?\\n   You bird of beauty and love,\\n     Why behave like a goose?\\n   Don\\'t sulk away from our sight,\\n     Like a common, contemptible fowl;\\n   You bird of joy and delight,\\n     Why behave like an owl?\\n\\n4. \"Only think of all you have done;\\n     Only think of all you can do;\\n   A false note is really fun\\n     From such a bird as you!\\n   Lift up your proud little crest,\\n     Open your musical beak;\\n   Other birds have to do their best,\\n     You need only to speak!\"\\n\\n6. The nightingale shyly took\\n     Her head from under her wing,\\n   And, giving the dove a look,\\n     Straightway began to sing.\\n   There was never a bird could pass;\\n     The night was divinely calm;\\n   And the people stood on the grass\\n     To hear that wonderful psalm.\\n\\n6. The nightingale did not care,\\n     She only sang to the skies;\\n   Her song ascended there,\\n     And there she fixed her eyes.\\n   The people that stood below\\n     She knew but little about;\\n   And this tale has a moral, I know,\\n     If you\\'ll try and find it out.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Saun\\'ter-ing, wandering idly, strolling. Snick\\'er, to\\nlaugh in a half-suppressed manner. 4. Crest, a tuft growing on an animal\\'s\\nhead. 5. Di-vine\\'ly, in a supreme degree. 6. Mor\\'al, the practical lesson\\nwhich anything is fitted to teach.\\n\\nNOTE.--The nightingale is a small bird, about six inches in length, with a\\ncoat of dark-brown feathers above and of grayish, white beneath. Its voice\\nis astonishingly strong and sweet, and, when wild, it usually sings\\nthroughout the evening and night from April to the middle of summer. The\\nbird is common in Europe, but is not found in America.\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. DO NOT MEDDLE.\\n\\n1. About twenty years ago there lived a singular gentleman in the Old Hall\\namong the elm trees. He was about three-score years of age, very rich, and\\nsomewhat odd in many of his habits, but for generosity and benevolence he\\nhad no equal.\\n\\n2. No poor cottager stood in need of comforts, which he was not ready to\\nsupply; no sick man or woman languished for want of his assistance; and\\nnot even a beggar, unless a known impostor, went empty-handed from the\\nHall. Like the village pastor described in Goldsmith\\'s poem of \"The\\nDeserted Village,\"\\n\\n  \"His house was known to all the vagrant train;\\n  He chid their wand\\'rings, but relieved their pain;\\n  The long-remembered beggar was his guest,\\n  Whose beard descending swept his aged breast.\"\\n\\n3. Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted a boy to wait upon him at\\ntable, and to attend him in different ways, for he was very fond of young\\npeople. But much as he liked the society of the young, he had a great\\naversion to that curiosity in which many young people are apt to indulge.\\nHe used to say, \"The boy who will peep into a drawer will be tempted to\\ntake something out of it; and he who will steal a penny in his youth will\\nsteal a pound in his manhood.\"\\n\\n4. No sooner was it known that the old gentleman was in want of a boy than\\ntwenty applications were made for the situation; but he determined not to\\nengage anyone until he had in some way ascertained that he did not possess\\na curious, prying disposition.\\n\\n5. On Monday morning seven lads, dressed in their Sunday clothes, with\\nbright and happy faces, made their appearance at the Hall, each of them\\ndesiring to obtain the situation. Now the old gentleman, being of a\\nsingular disposition had prepared a room in such a way that he might\\neasily know if any of the young people who applied were given to meddle\\nunnecessarily with things around them, or to peep into cupboards and\\ndrawers. He took care that the lads who were then at Elm Tree Hall should\\nbe shown into this room one after another.\\n\\n6. And first, Charles Brown was sent into the room, and told that he would\\nhave to wait a little. So Charles sat down on a chair near the door. For\\nsome time he was very quiet, and looked about him; but there seemed to be\\nso many curious things in the room that at last he got up to peep at\\nthem.\\n\\n7. On the table was placed a dish cover, and Charles wanted sadly to know\\nwhat was under it, but he felt afraid of lifting it up. Bad habits are\\nstrong things; and, as Charles was of a curious disposition, he could not\\nwithstand the temptation of taking one peep. So he lifted up the cover.\\n\\n8. This turned out to be a sad affair; for under the dish cover was a heap\\nof very light feathers; part of the feathers, drawn up by a current of\\nair, flew about the room, and Charles, in his fright, putting the cover\\ndown hastily, puffed the rest of them off the table.\\n\\n9. What was to be done? Charles began to pick up the feathers one by one;\\nbut the old gentleman, who was in an adjoining room, hearing a scuffle,\\nand guessing the cause of it, entered the room, to the consternation of\\nCharles Brown, who was very soon dismissed as a boy who had not principle\\nenough to resist even a slight temptation.\\n\\n10. When the room was once more arranged, Henry Wilkins was placed there\\nuntil such time as he should be sent for. No sooner was he left to himself\\nthan his attention was attracted by a plate of fine, ripe cherries. Now\\nHenry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and he thought it would be\\nimpossible to miss one cherry among so many. He looked and longed, and\\nlonged and looked, for some time, and just as he had got off his seat to\\ntake one, he heard, as he thought, a foot coming to the door; but no, it\\nwas a false alarm.\\n\\n11. Taking fresh courage, he went cautiously and took a very fine cherry,\\nfor he was determined to take but one, and put it into his mouth. It was\\nexcellent; and then he persuaded himself that he ran no risk in taking\\nanother; this he did, and hastily popped it into his mouth.\\n\\n12. Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artificial cherries at the top\\nof the others, filled with Cayenne pepper; one of these Henry had\\nunfortunately taken, and it made his month smart and burn most\\nintolerably. The old gentleman heard him coughing, and knew very well what\\nwas the matter. The boy that would take what did not belong to him, if no\\nmore than a cherry, was not the boy for him. Henry Wilkins was sent about\\nhis business without delay, with his mouth almost as hot as if he had put\\na burning coal in to it.\\n\\n13. Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room and left to himself;\\nbut he had not been there ten minutes before he began to move from one\\nplace to another. He was of a bold, resolute temper, but not overburdened\\nwith principle; for if he could have opened every cupboard, closet, and\\ndrawer in the house, without being found out, he would have done it\\ndirectly.\\n\\n14. Having looked around the room, he noticed a drawer to the table, and\\nmade up his mind to peep therein. But no sooner did he lay hold of the\\ndrawer knob than he set a large bell ringing, which was concealed under\\nthe table. The old gentleman immediately answered the summons, and entered\\nthe room.\\n\\n15. Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the bell, that all his\\nimpudence could not support him. He looked as though anyone might knock\\nhim down with a feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had rung the\\nbell because he wanted anything. Rufus was much confused and stammered,\\nand tried to excuse himself, but all to no purpose, for it did not prevent\\nhim from being ordered off the premises.\\n\\n16. George Jones was then shown into the room by an old steward; and being\\nof a cautious disposition, he touched nothing, but only looked at the\\nthings about him. At last he saw that a closet door was a little open,\\nand, thinking it would be impossible for anyone to know that he had opened\\nit a little more, he very cautiously opened it an inch farther, looking\\ndown at the bottom of the door, that it might not catch against anything\\nand make a noise.\\n\\n17. Now had he looked at the top, instead of the bottom, it\\nmight have been better for him; for to the top of the door was\\nfastened a plug, which filled up the hole of a small barrel of shot.\\nHe ventured to open the door another inch, and then another, till,\\nthe plug being pulled out of the barrel, the leaden shot began to\\npour out at a strange rate. At the bottom of the closet was placed a\\ntin pan, and the shot falling upon this pan made such a clatter that\\nGeorge was frightened half out of his senses.\\n\\n18. The old gentleman soon came into the room to inquire what was the\\nmatter, and there he found George nearly as pale as a sheet. George was\\nsoon dismissed.\\n\\n19. It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put into the room. The\\nother boys had been sent to their homes by different ways, and no one knew\\nwhat the experience of the other had been in the room of trial.\\n\\n20. On the table stood a small round box, with a screw top to it, and\\nAlbert, thinking it contained something curious, could not be easy without\\nunscrewing the top; but no sooner did he do this than out bounced an\\nartificial snake, full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. He started\\nback, and uttered a scream which brought the old gentleman to his elbow.\\nThere stood Albert, with the bottom of the box in one hand, the top in the\\nother, and the snake on the floor.\\n\\n21. \"Come, come,\" said the old gentleman, \"one snake is quite enough to\\nhave in the house at a time; therefore, the sooner you are gone the\\nbetter.\" With that he dismissed him, without waiting a moment for his\\nreply.\\n\\n22. William Smith next entered the room, and being left alone soon began\\nto amuse himself in looking at the curiosities around him. William was not\\nonly curious and prying, but dishonest, too, and observing that the key\\nwas left in the drawer of a bookcase, he stepped on tiptoe in that\\ndirection. The key had a wire fastened to it, which communicated with an\\nelectrical machine, and William received such a shock as he was not likely\\nto forget. No sooner did he sufficiently recover himself to walk, than he\\nwas told to leave the house, and let other people lock and unlock their\\nown drawers.\\n\\n23. The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he was left in the room\\nfull twenty minutes, he never during that time stirred from his chair.\\nHarry had eyes in his head as well as the others, but he had more\\nintegrity in his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the drawer\\nknob, the closet door, the round box, nor the key tempted him to rise from\\nhis feet; and the consequence was that, in half an hour after, he was\\nengaged in the service of the old gentleman at Elm Tree Hall. He followed\\nhis good old master to his grave, and received a large legacy for his\\nupright conduct in his service.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Lan\\'guished, suffered, sank away.

WORK.\\n\\nEliza Cook (b. 1817, d. 1889) was born at London. In 1837 she commenced\\ncontributing to periodicals. In 1840 the first collection of her poems was\\nmade. In 1849 she became editor of \"Eliza Cook\\'s Journal.\"\\n\\n1.

I doubt if he who lolls his head\\n     Where idleness and plenty meet,\\n   Enjoys his pillow or his bread\\n     As those who earn the meals they eat.\\n\\n6.

Stag\\'nant, inactive.\\n2. Tor\\'por, laziness, stupidity. 5. Lolls, reclines, leans.\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. THE MANIAC.\\n\\n1. A gentleman who had traveled in Europe, relates that he one day visited\\nthe hospital of Berlin, where he saw a man whose exterior was very\\nstriking. His figure, tall and commanding, was bending with age, but more\\nwith sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on his temples were\\nwhite almost as the driven snow, and the deepest melancholy was depicted\\nin his countenance.\\n\\n2. On inquiring who he was and what brought him there, he started, as, if\\nfrom sleep, and, after looking around him, began with slow and measured\\nsteps to stride the hall, repeating in a low but audible voice, \"Once one\\nis two; once one is two.\"\\n\\n3. Now and then he would stop, and remain with his arms folded on his\\nbreast as if in contemplation, for some minutes; then again resuming his\\nwalk, he continued to repeat, \"Once one is two; once one is two.\" His\\nstory, as our traveler understood it, is as follows:\\n\\n4. Conrad Lange, collector of the revenues of the city of Berlin, had long\\nbeen known as a man whom nothing could divert from the paths of honesty.\\nScrupulously exact in an his dealings, and assiduous in the discharge of\\nall his duties, he had acquired the good will and esteem of all who knew\\nhim, and the confidence of the minister of finance, whose duty it is to\\ninspect the accounts of all officers connected with the revenue.\\n\\n5. On casting up his accounts at the close of a particular year, he found\\na deficit of ten thousand ducats. Alarmed at this discovery, he went to\\nthe minister, presented his accounts, and informed him that he did not\\nknow how it had arisen, and that he had been robbed by some person bent on\\nhis ruin.\\n\\n6. The minister received his accounts, but thinking it a duty to secure a\\nperson who might probably be a defaulter he caused him to be arrested, and\\nput his accounts into the hands of one of his secretaries for inspection,\\nwho returned them the day after with the information that the deficiency\\narose from a miscalculation; that in multiplying, Mr. Lange had said, once\\none is two, instead of once one is one.\\n\\n7. The poor man was immediately released from confinement, his accounts\\nreturned, and the mistake pointed out. During his imprisonment, which\\nlasted two days, he had neither eaten, drunk, nor taken any repose; and\\nwhen he appeared, his countenance was as pale as death. On receiving his\\naccounts, he was a long time silent; then suddenly awaking, as if from a\\ntrance, he repeated, \"Once one is two.\"\\n\\n8. He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situation; would neither\\neat nor drink, unless solicited; and took notice of nothing that passed\\naround him. While repeating his accustomed phrase, if anyone corrected him\\nby saying, \"Once one is one,\" his attention was arrested for a moment, and\\nhe said, \"Ah, right, once one is one;\" and then resuming his walk, he\\ncontinued to repeat, \"Once one is two.\" He died shortly after the traveler\\nleft Berlin.\\n\\n9. This affecting story, whether true or untrue, obviously abounds with\\nlessons of instruction. Alas! how easily is the human mind thrown off its\\nbalance; especially when it is stayed on this world only, and has no\\nexperimental knowledge of the meaning of the injunction of Scripture, to\\ncast all our cares upon Him who careth for us, and who heareth even the\\nyoung ravens when they cry.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ex-te\\'ri-or, outward appearance. De-pict\\'ed, painted,\\nrepresented. 3. Con-tem-pla\\'tion, continued attention of the mind to one\\nsubject. 4.

ROBIN REDBREAST.\\n\\nWilliam Allingham (b. 1828, d. 1889) was born at Ballyshannon, Ireland.\\nHis father was a banker, and gave him a good education in Irish schools.\\nHe showed his literary tastes at an early date, contributing to\\nperiodicals, etc. In 1850 he published his first volume of poems; in 1854\\nhis \"Day and Night Songs\" appeared, and in 1864 a poem in twelve chapters\\nentitled \"Lawrence Bloomfield in Ireland,\" His reputation was established\\nchiefly through his shorter lyrics, or ballad poetry. In 1864 he received\\na literary pension.\\n\\n1. Good-by, good-by to Summer!\\n     For Summer\\'s nearly done;\\n   The garden smiling faintly,\\n     Cool breezes in the sun;\\n   Our thrushes now are silent,\\n     Our swallows flown away,--\\n   But Robin\\'s here in coat of brown,\\n     And scarlet brestknot gay.\\n   Robin, Robin Redbreast,\\n     O Robin dear!\\n   Robin sings so sweetly\\n     In the falling of the year.\\n\\n2.

It is only about half the\\nsize of the latter. Its prevailing color above is olive green, while the\\nforehead, cheeks, throat, and breast are a light yellowish red. It does\\nnot migrate, but is found at all seasons throughout temperate Europe, Asia\\nMinor, and northern Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\nXI. THE FISH I DID N\\'T CATCH.\\n\\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier was born near Haverhill, Mass., in 1807, and died\\nat Hampton Falls, N.H., in 1892. His boyhood was passed on a farm, and he\\nnever received a classical education. In 1829 he edited a newspaper in\\nBoston. In the following year he removed to Hartford, Conn., to assume a\\nsimilar position. In 1836 he edited an antislavery paper in Philadelphia.\\nIn 1840 he removed to Amesbury, Mass. Mr. Whittier\\'s parents were Friends,\\nand he always held to the same faith. He wrote extensively both in prose\\nand verse. As a poet, he ranked among those most highly esteemed and\\nhonored by his countrymen. \"Snow Bound\" is one of the longest and best of\\nhis poems.\\n\\n1. Our bachelor uncle who lived with us was a quiet, genial man, much\\ngiven to hunting and fishing; and it was one of the pleasures of our young\\nlife to accompany him on his expeditions to Great Hill, Brandy-brow Woods,\\nthe Pond, and, best of all, to the Country Brook. We were quite willing to\\nwork hard in the cornfield or the haying lot to finish the necessary day\\'s\\nlabor in season for an afternoon stroll through the woods and along the\\nbrookside.\\n\\n2. I remember my first fishing excursion as if it were but yesterday. I\\nhave been happy many times in my life, but never more intensely so than\\nwhen I received that first fishing pole from my uncle\\'s hand, and trudged\\noff with him through the woods and meadows. It was a still, sweet day of\\nearly summer; the long afternoon shadows of the trees lay cool across our\\npath; the leaves seemed greener, the flowers brighter, the birds merrier,\\nthan ever before.\\n\\n3. My uncle, who knew by long experience where were the best haunts of\\npickerel, considerately placed me at the most favorable point. I threw out\\nmy line as I had so often seen others, and waited anxiously for a bite,\\nmoving the bait in rapid jerks on the surface of the water in imitation of\\nthe leap of a frog. Nothing came of it. \"Try again,\" said my uncle.\\nSuddenly the bait sank out of sight. \"Now for it,\" thought I; \"here is a\\nfish at last.\"\\n\\n4. I made a strong pull, and brought up a tangle of weeds. Again and again\\nI cast out my line with aching arms, and drew it back empty. I looked at\\nmy uncle appealingly. \"Try once more,\" he said; \"we fishermen must have\\npatience.\"\\n\\n5. Suddenly something tugged at my line, and swept off with it into deep\\nwater. Jerking it up, I saw a fine pickerel wriggling in the sun. \"Uncle!\"\\nI cried, looking back in uncontrollable excitement, \"I\\'ve got a fish!\"\\n\"Not yet,\" said my uncle. As he spoke there was a plash in the water; I\\ncaught the arrowy gleam of a scared fish shooting into the middle of the\\nstream, my hook hung empty from the line. I had lost my prize.\\n\\n6. We are apt to speak of the sorrows of childhood as trifles in\\ncomparison with those of grown-up people; but we may depend upon it the\\nyoung folks don\\'t agree with us. Our griefs, modified and restrained by\\nreason, experience and self-respect, keep the proprieties, and, if\\npossible, avoid a scene; but the sorrow of childhood, unreasoning and\\nall-absorbing, is a complete abandonment to the passion. The doll\\'s nose\\nis broken, and the world breaks up with it; the marble rolls out of sight,\\nand the solid globe rolls off with the marble.\\n\\n7. So, overcome with my great and bitter disappointment, I sat down on the\\nnearest hassock, and for a time refused to be comforted, even by my\\nuncle\\'s assurance that there were more fish in the brook. He refitted my\\nbait, and, putting the pole again in my hands, told me to try my luck once\\nmore.\\n\\n8. \"But remember, boy,\" he said, with his shrewd smile, \"never brag of\\ncatching a fish until he is on dry ground. I\\'ve seen older folks doing\\nthat in more ways than one, and so making fools of themselves. It\\'s no use\\nto boast of anything until it\\'s done, nor then, either, for it speaks for\\nitself.\"\\n\\n9. How often since I have been reminded of the fish that I did not catch.\\nWhen I hear people boasting of a work as yet undone, and trying to\\nanticipate the credit which belongs only to actual achievement, I call to\\nmind that scene by the brookside, and the wise caution of my uncle in that\\nparticular instance takes the form of a proverb of universal application:\\n\"NEVER BRAG OF YOUR FISH BEFORE YOU CATCH HIM.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Gen\\'ial, cheerful. 3. Haunts, places frequently visited.\\nCon-sid\\'er-ate-ly, with due regard to others, kindly thoughtful. 4.\\nAp-peal\\'ing-ly, as though asking for aid. 6. Mod\\'i-fied, qualified,\\nlessened. Pro-pri\\'e-ties, fixed customs or rules of conduct. Ab-sorb\\'ing,\\nengaging the attention entirely. 7, Has\\'sock, a raised mound of turf. 9.\\nAn-tic\\'i-pate, to take before the proper time. A-chieve\\'ment, performance,\\ndeed.\\n\\n\\n\\nXII. IT SNOWS.\\n\\nSarah Josepha Hale (b. 1788?, d.1879) was born in Newport, N.H. Her maiden\\nname was Buell. In 1814 she married David Hale, an eminent lawyer, who\\ndied in 1822. Left with five children to support, she turned her attention\\nto literature. In 1828 she became editor of the \"Ladies\\' Magazine.\" In\\n1837 this periodical was united with \"Godey\\'s Lady\\'s Book,\" of which Mrs.\\nHale was literary editor for more than forty years.\\n\\n1. \"It snows!\" cries the Schoolboy, \"Hurrah!\" and his shout\\n     Is ringing through parlor and hall,\\n   While swift as the wing of a swallow, he\\'s out,\\n     And his playmates have answered his call;\\n   It makes the heart leap but to witness their joy;\\n     Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow,\\n   Like the rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy\\n     As he gathers his treasures of snow;\\n   Then lay not the trappings of gold on thine heirs,\\n     While health and the riches of nature are theirs.\\n\\n2. \"It snows!\" sighs the Imbecile, \"Ah!\" and his breath\\n     Comes heavy, as clogged with a weight;\\n   While, from the pale aspect of nature in death,\\n     He turns to the blaze of his grate;\\n   And nearer and nearer, his soft-cushioned chair\\n     Is wheeled toward the life-giving flame;\\n   He dreads a chill puff of the snow-burdened air,\\n     Lest it wither his delicate frame;\\n   Oh! small is the pleasure existence can give,\\n     When the fear we shall die only proves that we live!\\n\\n3. \"It snows!\" cries the Traveler, \"Ho!\" and the word\\n     Has quickened his steed\\'s lagging pace;\\n   The wind rushes by, but its howl is unheard,\\n     Unfelt the sharp drift in his face;\\n   For bright through the tempest his own home appeared,\\n     Ay, though leagues intervened, he can see:\\n   There\\'s the clear, glowing hearth, and the table prepared,\\n     And his wife with her babes at her knee;\\n   Blest thought! how it lightens the grief-laden hour,\\n     That those we love dearest are safe from its power!\\n\\n4. \"It snows!\" cries the Belle, \"Dear, how lucky!\" and turns\\n     From her mirror to watch the flakes fall,\\n   Like the first rose of summer, her dimpled cheek burns!\\n     While musing on sleigh ride and ball:\\n   There are visions of conquests, of splendor, and mirth,\\n     Floating over each drear winter\\'s day;\\n   But the tintings of Hope, on this storm-beaten earth,\\n     Will melt like the snowflakes away.\\n   Turn, then thee to Heaven, fair maiden, for bliss;\\n     That world has a pure fount ne\\'er opened in this.\\n\\n5. \"It snows!\" cries the Widow, \"O God!\" and her sighs\\n     Have stifled the voice of her prayer;\\n   Its burden ye\\'ll read in her tear-swollen eyes,\\n     On her cheek sunk with fasting and care.\\n   \\'T is night, and her fatherless ask her for bread,\\n     But \"He gives the young ravens their food,\"\\n   And she trusts till her dark hearth adds horror to dread.,\\n     And she lays on her last chip of wood.\\n   Poor sufferer! that sorrow thy God only knows;\\n     \\'T is a most bitter lot to be poor when it snows.\\n\\n\\n DEFINITIONS.--1.

Try to express\\nthe actual feeling of each quotation; and enter into the descriptions with\\nspirit.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII. RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH REWARDED.\\n\\n1. In the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a barber who made a\\npractice of following his ordinary occupation on the Lord\\'s day. As he was\\non the way to his morning\\'s employment, he happened to look into some\\nplace of worship just as the minister was giving out his text--\"Remember\\nthe Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" He listened long enough to be convinced\\nthat he was constantly breaking the laws of God and man by shaving and\\ndressing his customers on the Lord\\'s day. He became uneasy, and went with\\na heavy heart to his Sabbath task.\\n\\n2. At length he took courage, and opened his mind to his minister, who\\nadvised him to give up Sabbath work, and worship God. He replied that\\nbeggary would be the consequence. He had a flourishing trade, but it would\\nalmost all be lost. At length, after many a sleepless night spent in\\nweeping and praying, he was determined to cast all his care upon God, as\\nthe more he reflected, the more his duty became apparent.\\n\\n3. He discontinued his Sabbath work, went constantly and early to the\\npublic services of religion, and soon enjoyed that satisfaction of mind\\nwhich is one of the rewards of doing our duty, and that peace which the\\nworld can neither give nor take away. The consequences he foresaw actually\\nfollowed. His genteel customers left him, and he was nicknamed \"Puritan\"\\nor \"Methodist.\" He was obliged to give up his fashionable shop, and, in\\nthe course of years, became so reduced as to take a cellar under the old\\nmarket house and shave the poorer people.\\n\\n4. One Saturday evening, between light and dark, a stranger from one of\\nthe coaches, asking for a barber, was directed by the hostler to the\\ncellar opposite. Coming in hastily, he requested to be shaved quickly,\\nwhile they changed horses, as he did not like to violate the Sabbath. This\\nwas touching the barber on a tender chord. He burst into tears; asked the\\nstranger to lend him a half-penny to buy a candle, as it was not light\\nenough to shave him with safety. He did so, revolving in his mind the\\nextreme poverty to which the poor man must be reduced.\\n\\n5. When shaved, he said, \"There must be something extraordinary in your\\nhistory, which I have not now time to hear. Here is half a crown for you.\\nWhen I return, I will call and investigate your case. What is your name?\"\\n\"William Reed,\" said the astonished barber. \"William Reed?\" echoed the\\nstranger: \"William Reed? by your dialect you are from the West.\" \"Yes,\\nsir, from Kingston, near Taunton.\" \"William Reed from Kingston, near\\nTaunton? What was your father\\'s name?\" \"Thomas.\" \"Had he any brother?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, one, after whom I was named; but he went to the Indies, and, as\\nwe never heard from him, we supposed him to be dead.\"\\n\\n6. \"Come along, follow me,\" said the stranger, \"I am going to see a person\\nwho says his name is William Reed, of Kingston, near Taunton. Come and\\nconfront him. If you prove to be indeed he who you say you are, I have\\nglorious news for you. Your uncle is dead, and has left an immense\\nfortune, which I will put you in possession of when all legal doubts are\\nremoved.\"\\n\\n7. They went by the coach; saw the pretended William Reed, and proved him\\nto be an impostor. The stranger, who was a pious attorney, was soon\\nlegally satisfied of the barber\\'s identity, and told him that he had\\nadvertised him in vain. Providence had now thrown him in his way in a most\\nextraordinary manner, and he had great pleasure in transferring a great\\nmany thousand pounds to a worthy man, the rightful heir of the property.\\nThus was man\\'s extremity God\\'s opportunity. Had the poor barber possessed\\none half-penny, or even had credit for a candle, he might have remained\\nunknown for years; but he trusted God, who never said, \"Seek ye my face,\"\\nin vain.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Ap-par\\'ent, clear, plain. 3. Gen-teel\\', fashionable,\\nelegant. Re-duced\\', brought to poverty. 4. Vi\\'o-late, to break, to\\nprofane. 5. In-ves\\'ti-gate, to inquire into with care.

Op-por-tu\\'ni-ty, favorable time.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV. THE SANDS O\\' DEE.\\n\\nCharles Kingsley (b.1819, d.1875) was born at Holne, Devonshire, England.\\nHe took his bachelor\\'s degree at Cambridge in 1842, and soon after entered\\nthe Church. His writings are quite voluminous, including sermons,\\nlectures, novels, fairy tales, and poems, published in book form, besides\\nnumerous miscellaneous sermons and magazine articles. He was an earnest\\nworker for bettering the condition of the working classes, and this object\\nwas the basis of most of his writings. As a lyric poet he has gained a\\nhigh place. The \"Saint\\'s Tragedy\" and \"Andromeda\" are the most pretentious\\nof his poems, and \"Alton Locke\" and \"Hypatia\" are his best known novels.\\n\\n\\n1. \"O Mary, go and call the cattle home,\\n       And call the cattle home,\\n       And call the cattle home,\\n     Across the sands o\\' Dee!\"\\n   The western wind was wild and dank with foam,\\n     And all alone went she.\\n\\n2. The creeping tide came up along the sand,\\n       And o\\'er and o\\'er the sand,\\n       And round and round the sand,\\n     As far as eye could see;\\n   The blinding mist came down and hid the land--\\n     And never home came she.\\n\\n3. Oh, is it weed, or fish, or floating hair?--\\n       A tress o\\' golden hair,\\n       O\\' drowned maiden\\'s hair,\\n     Above the nets at sea.\\n   Was never salmon yet that shone so fair\\n     Among the stakes on Dee.\\n\\n4. They rowed her in across the rolling foam,\\n       The cruel, crawling foam,\\n       The cruel, hungry foam,\\n     To her grave beside the sea;\\n   But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home,\\n     Across the sands O\\' Dee.\\n\\nNotes.--The Sands O\\' Dee.\\n        The Dee is a river of Scotland, noted for its salmon fisheries.\\n        O\\' is a contraction for of, commonly used by the Scotch.\\n\\nRKMARK.--The first three lines of each stanza deserve special attention in\\nreading. The final words are nearly or quite the same, but the expression\\nof each line should vary. The piece should be read in a low key and with a\\npure, musical tone.\\n\\n\\n\\nXV. SELECT PARAGRAPHS.\\n\\n1. O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds\\namong the people. Sing unto him; sing psalms unto him; talk ye of all his\\nwondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name; let the heart of them rejoice\\nthat seek the Lord. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his\\nwonders, and the judgments of his mouth.\\n\\n2. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast\\nset thy glory above the heavens. When I consider thy heavens, the work of\\nthy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained; what is man,\\nthat thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\\nFor thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned\\nhim with glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over the work\\nof thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. O Lord, our Lord,\\nhow excellent is thy name in all the earth!\\n\\n3. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God; in him\\nwill I trust. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I\\ndeliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He\\nshall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble;\\nI will deliver him, and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and\\nshow him my salvation.\\n\\n4. O come, let us sing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the\\nstrength of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with\\nthanksgiving, and show ourselves glad in him with psalms. For the Lord is\\na great God, and a great King above all gods. O worship the Lord in the\\nbeauty of holiness; let the whole earth stand in awe of him. For he\\ncometh, for he cometh, to judge the earth; and with righteousness to judge\\nthe world, and the people with his truth.\\n\\n5. Oh that men would praise the Lord\\' for his goodness, and for his\\nwonderful works to the children of men! They that go down to the sea in\\nships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord,\\nand  his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy\\nwind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven;\\nthey go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble;\\nthey reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their\\nwit\\'s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth\\nthem out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the\\nwaves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he\\nbringeth them unto their desired haven. Oh that men would praise the Lord\\nfor his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!\\n\\n6. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in\\ngreen pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my\\nsoul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\\'s sake.\\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear\\nno evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.\\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou\\nanointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and\\nmercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I1 will dwell in the\\nhouse of the Lord forever.\\n                                                              --Bible.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE CORN SONG.\\n\\n1. Heap high the farmer\\'s wintry hoard!\\n     Heap high the golden corn!\\n   No richer gift has Autumn poured\\n     From out her lavish horn!\\n\\n2. Let other lands, exulting, glean\\n     The apple from the pine,\\n   The orange from its glossy green,\\n     The cluster from the vine;\\n\\n3. We better love the hardy gift\\n     Our rugged vales bestow,\\n   To cheer us, when the storm shall drift\\n     Our harvest fields with snow.\\n\\n4. Through vales of grass and meads of flowers\\n     Our plows their furrows made,\\n   While on the hills the sun and showers\\n     Of changeful April played.\\n\\n5. We dropped the seed o\\'er hill and plain,\\n     Beneath the sun of May,\\n   And frightened from our sprouting grain\\n     The robber crows away.\\n\\n6. All through the long, bright days of June,\\n     Its leaves grew green and fair,\\n   And waved in hot midsummer\\'s noon\\n     Its soft and yellow hair.\\n\\n7. And now, with Autumn\\'s moonlit eves,\\n     Its harvest time has come;\\n   We pluck away the frosted leaves\\n     And bear the treasure home.\\n\\n8. There, richer than the fabled gift\\n     Apollo showered of old,\\n   Fair hands the broken grain shall sift,\\n     And knead its meal of gold.\\n\\n9. Let vapid idlers loll in silk,\\n     Around their costly board;\\n   Give us the bowl of samp and milk,\\n     By homespun beauty poured!\\n\\n10. Where\\'er the wide old kitchen hearth\\n      Sends up its smoky curls,\\n    Who will not thank the kindly earth\\n      And bless our farmer girls!\\n\\n11. Then shame on all the proud and vain,\\n      Whose folly laughs to scorn\\n    The blessing of our hardy grain,\\n      Our wealth of golden corn!\\n\\n12. Let earth withhold her goodly root;\\n      Let mildew blight the rye,\\n    Give to the worm the orchard\\'s fruit,\\n      The wheat field to the fly:\\n\\n13. But let the good old crop adorn\\n      The hills our fathers trod;\\n    Still let us, for his golden corn,\\n      Send up our thanks to God!\\n                                      From Whittier\\'s \"Songs of Labor.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE VENOMOUS WORM.\\n\\nJohn Russell (b. 1793, d. 1863) graduated at Middlebury College, Vt., in\\n1818. He was at one time editor of the \"Backwoodsman,\" published at\\nGrafton, Ill., and later of the \"Louisville Advocate.\" He was the author\\nof many tales of western adventure and of numerous essays, sketches, etc.\\nHis language is clear, chaste, and classical; his style concise, vigorous,\\nand sometimes highly ornate.\\n\\n1. Who has not heard of the rattlesnake or copperhead? An unexpected sight\\nof either of these reptiles will make even the lords of creation recoil;\\nbut there is a species of worm, found in various parts of this country,\\nwhich conveys a poison of a nature so deadly that, compared with it, even\\nthe venom of the rattlesnake is harmless. To guard our readers against\\nthis foe of human kind is the object of this lesson.\\n\\n2. This worm varies much in size. It is frequently an inch in diameter,\\nbut, as it is rarely seen except when coiled, its length can hardly be\\nconjectured. It is of a dull lead color, and generally lives near a spring\\nor small stream of water, and bites the unfortunate people who are in the\\nhabit of going there to drink. The brute creation it never molests. They\\navoid it with the same instinct that teaches the animals of India to shun\\nthe deadly cobra.\\n\\n3. Several of these reptiles have long infested our settlements, to the\\nmisery and destruction of many of our fellow citizens. I have, therefore,\\nhad frequent opportunities of being the melancholy spectator of the\\neffects produced by the subtile poison which this worm infuses.\\n\\n4. The symptoms of its bite are terrible. The eyes of the patient become\\nred and fiery, his tongue swells to an immoderate size, and obstructs his\\nutterance; and delirium of the most horrid character quickly follows.\\nSometimes, in his madness, he attempts the destruction of his nearest\\nfriends.\\n\\n5. If the sufferer has a family, his weeping wife and helpless infants are\\nnot unfrequently the objects of his frantic fury. In a word, he exhibits,\\nto the life, all the detestable passions that rankle in the bosom of a\\nsavage; and such is the spell in which his senses are locked, that no\\nsooner has the unhappy patient recovered from the paroxysm of insanity\\noccasioned by the bite, than he seeks out the destroyer for the sole\\npurpose of being bitten again.\\n\\n6. I have seen a good old father, his locks as white as snow, his step\\nslow and trembling, beg in vain of his only son to quit the lurking place\\nof the worm. My heart bled when he turned away; for I knew the fond hope\\nthat his son would be the \"staff of his declining years,\" had supported\\nhim through many a sorrow.\\n\\n7. Youths of America, would you know the name of this reptile? It is\\ncalled the WORM OF THE STILL.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Rep\\'tiles, animals that crawl, as snakes, liz-ards, etc.\\nRe-coil\\', to start back, to shrink from. 2. Co\\'bra, a highly venomous\\nreptile inhabiting the East Indies. In-fest\\'ed, troubled, annoyed. 3.\\nSub\\'tile, acute, piercing. In-fus\\'es, intro-duces. 4. Ob-structs\\',\\nhinders. De-lir\\'i-um, a wandering of the mind. 5. Ran\\'kle, to rage.\\nPar\\'ox-ysm, a fit, a convulsion. 7. Worm, a spiral metallic pipe used in\\ndistilling liquors. Still, a vessel used in distilling or making liquors.\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII. THE FESTAL BOARD.\\n\\n1. Come to the festal board tonight,\\n     For bright-eyed beauty will be there,\\n   Her coral lips in nectar steeped,\\n     And garlanded her hair.\\n\\n2. Come to the festal board to-night,\\n     For there the joyous laugh of youth\\n   Will ring those silvery peals, which speak\\n     Of bosom pure and stainless truth.\\n\\n3. Come to the festal board to-night,\\n     For friendship, there, with stronger chain,\\n   Devoted hearts already bound\\n     For good or ill, will bind again.\\n                      I went.\\n\\n4. Nature and art their stores outpoured;\\n     Joy beamed in every kindling glance;\\n   Love, friendship, youth, and beauty smiled;\\n     What could that evening\\'s bliss enhance?\\n                      We parted.\\n\\n5. And years have flown; but where are now\\n     The guests who round that table met?\\n   Rises their sun as gloriously\\n     As on the banquet\\'s eve it set?\\n\\n6. How holds the chain which friendship wove?\\n     It broke; and soon the hearts it bound\\n   Were widely sundered; and for peace,\\n     Envy and strife and blood were found.\\n\\n7. The merriest laugh which then was heard\\n     Has changed its tones to maniac screams,\\n   As half-quenched memory kindles up\\n     Glimmerings of guilt in feverish dreams.\\n\\n8. And where is she whose diamond eyes\\n     Golconda\\'s purest gems outshone?\\n   Whose roseate lips of Eden breathed?\\n     Say, where is she, the beauteous one?\\n\\n9. Beneath yon willow\\'s drooping shade,\\n     With eyes now dim, and lips all pale,\\n   She sleeps in peace. Read on her urn,\\n   \"A broken heart.\" This tells her tale.\\n\\n10. And where is he, that tower of strength,\\n      Whose fate with hers for life was joined?\\n    How beats his heart, once honor\\'s throne?\\n      How high has soared his daring mind?\\n\\n11. Go to the dungeon\\'s gloom to-night;\\n      His wasted form, his aching head,\\n    And all that now remains of him,\\n      Lies, shuddering, on a felon\\'s bed.\\n\\n12. Ask you of all these woes the cause?\\n      The festal board, the enticing bowl,\\n    More often came, and reason fled,\\n      And maddened passions spurned control.\\n\\n13. Learn wisdom, then. The frequent feast\\n      Avoid; for there, with stealthy tread\\n    Temptation walks, to lure you on,\\n      Till death, at last, the banquet spread.\\n\\n14. And shun, oh shun, the enchanted cup!\\n      Though now its draught like joy appears,\\n    Ere long it will be fanned by sighs,\\n      And sadly mixed with blood and tears.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Fes\\'tal, mirthful, joyous. Gar\\'land-ed, adorned with\\nwreaths of flowers. 3. De-vot\\'ed, solemnly set apart. 4. En-hance\\',\\nincrease. 6. Sun\\'dered, separated. 7. Glim\\'mer-ings, faint views,\\nglimpses. 8. Ro\\'se-ate, blooming, rosy. 11. Fel\\'on, a public criminal. 12.\\nEn-tic\\'ing, attracting to evil. Spurned, rejected with disdain. 13. Lure,\\nto attract, to entice. 14. En-chant\\'ed, affected with enchantment,\\nbewitched.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--8. Golconda is an ancient city and fortress of India, formerly\\nrenowned for its diamonds. They were merely cut and polished there,\\nhowever, being generally brought from Parteall, a city farther south.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX. HOW TO TELL BAD NEWS.\\n\\nMr. H. and the Steward.\\n\\nMr. H. Ha! Steward, how are you, my old boy? How do things go on at home?\\n\\nSteward. Bad enough, your honor; the magpie\\'s dead.\\n\\nH. Poor Mag! So he\\'s gone. How came he to die?\\n\\nS. Overeat himself, sir.\\n\\nH. Did he? A greedy dog; why, what did he get he liked so well?\\n\\nS. Horseflesh, sir; he died of eating horseflesh,\\n\\nH. How came he to get so much horseflesh?\\n\\nS. All your father\\'s horses, sir.\\n\\nH. What! are they dead, too?\\n\\nS. Ay, sir; they died of overwork.\\n\\nH. And why were they overworked, pray?\\n\\nS. To carry water, sir.\\n\\nH. To carry water! and what were they carrying water for?\\n\\nS. Sure, sir, to put out the fire.\\n\\nH. Fire! what fire?\\n\\nS. O, sir, your father\\'s house is burned to the ground.\\n\\nH. My father\\'s house burned down! and how came it set on fire?\\n\\nS. I think, sir, it must have been the torches.\\n\\nH. Torches! what torches?\\n\\nS. At your mother\\'s funeral.\\n\\nH. My mother dead!\\n\\nS. Ah, poor lady! she never looked up, after it.\\n\\nH. After what?\\n\\nS. The loss of your father.\\n\\nH. My father gone, too?\\n\\nS. Yes, poor gentleman! he took to his bed as soon as he heard of it.\\n\\nH. Heard of what?\\n\\nS. The bad news, sir, and please your honor.\\n\\nH. What! more miseries! more bad news!\\n\\nS. Yes, sir; your bank has failed, and your credit is lost, and you are\\nnot worth a shilling in the world. I made bold, sir, to wait on you about\\nit, for I thought you would like to hear the news.\\n\\n\\n\\nXX. THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM.\\n\\nRobert Southey (b. 1774, d. 1843) was born in Bristol, England. He entered\\nBalliol College, Oxford, in 1793. In 1804 he established himself\\npermanently at Greta Hall, near Keswick, Cumberland, in the \"Lake\\nCountry,\" where he enjoyed the friendship and society of Wordsworth and\\nColeridge, other poets of the \"Lake School.\" He was appointed poet\\nlaureate in 1813, and received a pension of 300 Pounds a year from the\\ngovernment in 1835. Mr. Southey was a voluminous writer in both prose and\\nverse. As a poet, he can not be placed in the first rank, although some of\\nhis minor poems are very happy in thought and expression. Among his most\\nnoted poetical works are \"Joan of Arc,\" \"Thalaba the Destroyer,\" \"Madoc,\"\\n\"Roderick,\" and the \"Curse of Kehama,\"\\n\\n1. It was a summer evening,\\n     Old Kaspar\\'s work was done,\\n   And he, before his cottage door,\\n     Was sitting in the sun;\\n   And by him sported on the green,\\n   His little grandchild Wilhelmine.\\n\\n2. She saw her brother Peterkin\\n     Roll something large and round,\\n   Which he beside the rivulet,\\n     In playing there, had found;\\n   He came to ask what he had found,\\n   That was so large, and smooth, and round.\\n\\n3. Old Kaspar took it from the boy,\\n     Who stood expectant by;\\n   And then the old man shook his head,\\n     And, with a natural sigh,\\n   \" \\'T is some poor fellow\\'s skull,\" said he,\\n   \"Who fell in the great victory.\\n\\n4. \"I find them in the garden,\\n     For there\\'s many hereabout;\\n   And often when I go to plow,\\n     The plowshare turns them out;\\n   For many thousand men,\" said he,\\n   \"Were slain in that great victory.\"\\n\\n5. \"Now tell us what \\'t was all about,\"\\n     Young Peterkin he cries;\\n   While little Wilhelmine looks up\\n     With wonder-waiting eyes;\\n   \"Now tell us all about the war,\\n   And what they killed each other for.\"\\n\\n6. \"It was the English,\" Kaspar cried,\\n     \"Who put the French to rout,\\n   But what they killed each other for,\\n     I could not well make out;\\n   But everybody said,\" quoth he,\\n   \"That \\'t was a famous victory:\\n\\n7, \"My father lived at Blenheim then,\\n     Yon little stream, hard by;\\n   They burnt his dwelling to the ground,\\n     And he was forced to fly;\\n   So, with his wife and child he fled,\\n   Nor had he where to rest his head.\\n\\n8. \"With fire and sword, the country round\\n     Was wasted, far and wide;\\n   And many a nursing mother then,\\n     And newborn baby died;\\n   But things like that, you know, must be\\n   At every famous victory.\\n\\n9. \"They say it was a shocking sight\\n     After the field was won;\\n   For many thousand bodies here\\n     Lay rotting in the sun:\\n   But things like that, you know, must be\\n   After a famous victory.\\n\\n10. \"Great praise the Duke of Marlboro\\' won,\\n      And our young prince, Eugene.\"\\n    \"Why, \\'t was a very wicked thing!\"\\n      Said little Wilhelmine.\\n    \"Nay, nay, my little girl!\" quoth he,\\n    \"It was a famous victory.\\n\\n11. \"And everybody praised the Duke\\n      Who this great fight did win.\"\\n    \"But what good came of it at last?\"\\n      Quoth little Peterkin.\\n    \"Why, that I can not tell,\" said he,\\n    \"But \\'t was a glorious victory.\"\\n\\nNOTES.--The Battle of Blenheim, in the \"War of the Spanish Succession,\"\\nwas fought August 13, 1704, near Blenheim, in Bavaria, between the French\\nand Bavarians, on one Ride, and an allied army under the great English\\ngeneral, the Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene, Prince of Savoy, on the\\nother. The latter won a decisive victory: 10,000 of the defeated army were\\nkilled and wounded, and 13,000 were taken prisoners.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI. \"I PITY THEM.\"\\n\\n1. A poor man once undertook to emigrate from Castine, Me., to Illinois.\\nWhen he was attempting to cross a river in New York, his horse broke\\nthrough the rotten timbers of the bridge, and was drowned. He had but this\\none animal to convey all his property and his family to his new home.\\n\\n2. His wife and children were almost miraculously saved from sharing the\\nfate of the horse; but the loss of this poor animal was enough. By its aid\\nthe family, it may be said, had lived and moved; now they were left\\nhelpless in a land of strangers, without the ability to go on or return,\\nwithout money or a single friend to whom to appeal. The case was a hard\\none.\\n\\n3. There were a great many who \"passed by on the other side.\" Some even\\nlaughed at the predicament in which the man was placed; but by degrees a\\ngroup of people began to collect, all of whom pitied him.\\n\\n4. Some pitied him a great deal, and some did not pity him very much,\\nbecause, they said, he might have known better than to try to cross an\\nunsafe bridge, and should have made his horse swim the river. Pity,\\nhowever, seemed rather to predominate. Some pitied the man, and some the\\nhorse; all pitied the poor, sick mother and her six helpless children.\\n\\n5. Among this pitying party was a rough son of the West, who knew what it\\nwas to migrate some hundreds of miles over new roads to locate a destitute\\nfamily on a prairie. Seeing the man\\'s forlorn situation, and looking\\naround on the bystanders, he said, \"All of you seem to pity these poor\\npeople very much, but I would beg leave to ask each of you how much.\"\\n\\n6. \"There, stranger,\" continued he, holding up a ten dollar bill, \"there\\nis the amount of my pity; and if others will do as I do, you may soon get\\nanother pony. God bless you.\" It is needless to state the effect that this\\nactive charity produced. In a short time the happy emigrant arrived at his\\ndestination, and he is now a thriving farmer, and a neighbor to him who\\nwas his \"friend in need, and a friend indeed.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Em\\'i-grate, to remove from one country or state to\\nanother for the purpose of residence, to migrate. 2. Mi-rac\\'u-lous-ly, as\\nif by miracle, wonderfully. A-bil\\'i-ty, power, capability. 3.\\nPre-dic\\'a-ment, condition, plight. 4. Pre-dom\\'i-nate, to prevail, to rule.\\n5. Lo\\'cate, to place. Des\\'ti-tute, needy, poor. 6. Des-ti-na\\'tion, end of\\na journey. Thriv\\'ing, prosperous through industry, economy, and good\\nmanagement.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII. AN ELEGY ON MADAM BLAIZE.\\n\\nOliver Goldsmith (b. 1728, d. 1774) was born at Pallas, or Pallasmore, in\\nthe parish of Forney, Ireland. He received his education at several\\nschools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at Leyden. He spent\\nsome time in wandering over continental Europe, often in poverty and want.\\nIn 1756 he became a resident of London, where he made the acquaintance of\\nseveral celebrated men, among whom were Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua\\nReynolds. His writings are noted for their purity, grace, and fluency. His\\nfame as a poet is secured by \"The Traveler,\" and \"The Deserted Village;\"\\nas a dramatist, by \"She Stoops to Conquer;\" and as a novelist, by \"The\\nVicar of Wakefield.\" His reckless extravagance always kept him in\\nfinancial difficulty, and he died heavily in debt. His monument is in\\nWestminster Abbey.\\n\\n1. Good people all, with one accord,\\n     Lament for Madam Blaize,\\n   Who never wanted a good word--\\n     From those who spoke her praise.\\n\\n2. The needy seldom passed her door,\\n     And always found her kind;\\n   She freely lent to all the poor--\\n     Who left a pledge behind.\\n\\n3. She strove the neighborhood to please,\\n     With manner wondrous winning:\\n   She never followed wicked ways--\\n     Unless when she was sinning.\\n\\n4. At church, in silks and satin new,\\n     With hoop of monstrous size,\\n   She never slumbered in her pew--\\n     But when she shut her eyes.\\n\\n5. Her love was sought, I do aver,\\n     By twenty beaux and more;\\n   The king himself has followed her\\n     When she has walked before.\\n\\n6. But now, her wealth and finery fled,\\n     Her hangers-on cut short all,\\n   Her doctors found, when she was dead--\\n     Her last disorder mortal.\\n\\n7. Let us lament, in sorrow sore;\\n     For Kent Street well may say,\\n   That, had she lived a twelvemonth more--\\n     She had not died to-day.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ac-cord\\', agreement of opinion, consent. 2. Pledge,\\npersonal property delivered to another as a security for a debt. 6.\\nHang\\'ers-on, followers. Mor\\'tal, destructive to life.\\n\\n\\nXXIII. KING CHARLES II AND WILLIAM PENN.\\n\\nKing Charles. Well, friend William! I have sold you a noble province in\\nNorth America; but still, I suppose you have no thoughts of going thither\\nyourself?\\n\\nPenn. Yes, I have, I assure thee, friend Charles; and I am just come to\\nbid thee farewell.\\n\\nK.C. What! venture yourself among the savages of North America! Why, man,\\nwhat security have you that you will not be in their war kettle in two\\nhours after setting foot on their shores?\\n\\nP. The best security in the world.\\n\\nK.C. I doubt that, friend William; I have no idea of any security against\\nthose cannibals but in a regiment of good soldiers, with their muskets and\\nbayonets. And mind, I tell you beforehand, that, with all my good will for\\nyou and your family, to whom I am under obligations, I will not send a\\nsingle soldier with you.\\n\\nP. I want none of thy soldiers, Charles: I depend on something better than\\nthy soldiers.\\n\\nK.C. Ah! what may that be?\\n\\nP. Why, I depend upon themselves; on the working of their own hearts; on\\ntheir notions of justice; on their moral sense.\\n\\nK.C. A fine thing, this same moral sense, no doubt; but I fear you will\\nnot find much of it among the Indians of North America.\\n\\nP. And why not among them as well as others?\\n\\nK.C. Because if they had possessed any, they would not have treated my\\nsubjects so barbarously as they have done.\\n\\nP. That is no proof of the contrary, friend Charles. Thy subjects\\nwere the aggressors. When thy subjects first went to North\\nAmerica, they found these poor people the fondest and kindest\\ncreatures in the world. Every day they would watch for them to\\ncome ashore, and hasten to meet them, and feast them on the best\\nfish, and venison, and corn, which were all they had. In return for\\nthis hospitality of the savages, as we call them, thy subjects,\\ntermed Christians, seized on their country and rich hunting\\ngrounds for farms for themselves. Now, is it to be wondered at,\\nthat these much-injured people should have been driven to\\ndesperation by such injustice; and that, burning with revenge, they\\nshould have committed some excesses?\\n\\nK C. Well, then, I hope you will not complain when they come to treat you\\nin the same manner.\\n\\nP. I am not afraid of it.\\n\\nK.C. Ah! how will you avoid it? You mean to get their hunting grounds,\\ntoo, I suppose?\\n\\nP. Yes, but not by driving these poor people away from them.\\n\\nK.C. No, indeed? How then will you get their lands?\\n\\nP. I mean to buy their lands of them.\\n\\nK.C. Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have already bought them of\\nme!\\n\\nP. Yes, I know I have, and at a dear rate, too; but I did it only to get\\nthy good will, not that I thought thou hadst any right to their lands.\\n\\nK.C. How, man? no right to their lands?\\n\\nP. No, friend Charles, no right; no right at all: what right hast thou to\\ntheir lands?\\n\\nK.C. Why, the right of discovery, to be sure; the right which the Pope and\\nall Christian kings have agreed to give one another.\\n\\nP. The right of discovery? A strange kind of right, indeed. Now suppose,\\nfriend Charles, that some canoe load of these Indians, crossing the sea,\\nand discovering this island of Great Britain, were to claim it as their\\nown, and set it up for sale over thy head, what wouldst thou think of it?\\n\\nK.C. Why--why--why--I must confess, I should think it a piece of great\\nimpudence in them.\\n\\nP. Well, then, how canst thou, a Christian, and a Christian prince, too,\\ndo that which thou so utterly condemnest in these people whom thou callest\\nsavages? And suppose, again, that these Indians, on thy refusal to give up\\nthy island of Great Britain, were to make war on thee, and, having weapons\\nmore destructive than thine, were to destroy many of thy subjects, and\\ndrive the rest away--wouldst thou not think it horribly cruel?\\n\\nK. C. I must say, friend William, that I should; how can I say otherwise?\\n\\nP. Well, then, how can I, who call myself a Christian, do what I should\\nabhor even in the heathen? No. I will not do it. But I will buy the right\\nof the proper owners, even of the Indians themselves. By doing this, I\\nshall imitate God himself in his justice and mercy, and thereby insure his\\nblessing on my colony, if I should ever live to plant one in North\\nAmerica.\\n                                                          --Mason L. Weems.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--Can\\'ni-bals, human beings that eat human flesh. Reg\\'i-ment,\\na body of troops, consisting usually of ten companies. Ag-gress\\'ors, those\\nwho first commence hostilities. Ven\\'i-son (pro. ven\\'i-zn, or ven\\'zn), the\\nflesh of deer. Ex-cess\\'es, misdeeds, evil acts. Con-demn\\'est (pro.\\nkon-dem\\'est), censure, blame.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Charles II. was king of England from A.D. 1660 to\\n1685. William Penn (b. 1644, d. 1718) was a noted Englishman\\nwho belonged to the sect of Friends. He came to America in 1682,\\nand founded the province which is now the state of Pennsylvania.\\nHe purchased the lands from the Indians, who were so impressed\\nwith the justice and good will of Penn and his associates, that the\\nQuaker dress often served as a sure protection when other settlers\\nwere trembling for their lives.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV. WHAT I LIVE FOR.\\n\\n1. I live for those who love me,\\n     Whose hearts are kind and true;\\n   For the heaven that smiles above me,\\n     And awaits my spirit, too;\\n   For all human ties that bind me,\\n   For the task my God assigned me,\\n   For the bright hopes left behind me,\\n     And the good that I can do.\\n\\n2. I live to learn their story,\\n     Who suffered for my sake;\\n   To emulate their glory,\\n     And follow in their wake;\\n   Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages,\\n   The noble of all ages,\\n   Whose deeds crown History\\'s pages,\\n     And Time\\'s great volume make.\\n\\n3.

It was Saturday night, and the widow of the Pine Cottage sat by her\\nblazing fagots, with her five tattered children at her side, endeavoring\\nby listening to the artlessness of their prattle to dissipate the heavy\\ngloom that pressed upon her mind. For a year, her own feeble hand had\\nprovided for her helpless family, for she had no supporter: she thought of\\nno friend in all the wide, unfriendly world around.\\n\\n2. But that mysterious Providence, the wisdom of whose ways is above human\\ncomprehension, had visited her with wasting sickness, and her little means\\nhad become exhausted. It was now, too, midwinter, and the snow lay heavy\\nand deep through all the surrounding forests, while storms still seemed\\ngathering in the heavens, and the driving wind roared amid the neighboring\\npines, and rocked her puny mansion.\\n\\n3. The last herring smoked upon the coals before her; it was the only\\narticle of food she possessed, and no wonder her forlorn, desolate state\\nbrought up in her lone bosom all the anxieties of a mother when she looked\\nupon her children: and no wonder, forlorn as she was, if she suffered the\\nheart swellings of despair to rise, even though she knew that He, whose\\npromise is to the widow and to the orphan, can not forget his word.\\n\\n4. Providence had many years before taken from her her eldest son, who\\nwent from his forest home to try his fortune on the high seas, since which\\nshe had heard no tidings of him; and in her latter time had, by the hand\\nof death, deprived her of the companion and staff of her earthly\\npilgrimage, in the person of her husband. Yet to this hour she had\\nupborne; she had not only been able to provide for her little flock, but\\nhad never lost an opportunity of ministering to the wants of the miserable\\nand destitute.\\n\\n5. The indolent may well bear with poverty while the ability to gain\\nsustenance remains. The individual who has but his own wants to supply may\\nsuffer with fortitude the winter of want; his affections are not wounded,\\nhis heart is not wrung. The most desolate in populous cities may hope, for\\ncharity has not quite closed her hand and heart, and shut her eyes on\\nmisery.\\n\\n6. But the industrious mother of helpless and depending children, far from\\nthe reach of human charity, has none of these to console her. And such a\\none was the widow of the Pine Cottage; but as she bent over the fire, and\\ntook up the last scanty remnant of food to spread before her children, her\\nspirits seemed to brighten up, as by some sudden and mysterious impulse,\\nand Cowper\\'s beautiful lines came uncalled across her mind:\\n\\n     \"Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.\\n       But trust him for his grace;\\n     Behind a frowning Providence\\n       He hides a smiling face.\"\\n\\n7. The smoked herring was scarcely laid upon the table, when a gentle rap\\nat the door, and the loud barking of a dog, attracted the attention of the\\nfamily. The children flew to open it, and a weary traveler, in tattered\\ngarments and in apparently indifferent health; entered, and begged a\\nlodging and a mouthful of food. Said he: \"It is now twenty-four hour\\'s\\nsince I tasted bread.\" The widow\\'s heart bled anew, as under a fresh\\ncomplication of distresses; for her sympathies lingered not around her\\nfireside. She hesitated not even now; rest, and a share of all she had,\\nshe proffered to the stranger. \"\\'We shall not be forsaken,\" said she, \"or\\nsuffer deeper for an act of charity.\"\\n\\n8. The traveler drew near the board, but when he saw the scanty fare, he\\nraised his eyes toward heaven with astonishment: \"And is this all your\\nstore?\" said he; \"and a share of this do you offer to one you know not?\\nthen never saw I charity before! But, madam,\" said he, continuing, \"do you\\nnot wrong your children by giving a part of your last mouthful to a\\nstranger?\"\\n\\n9. \"Ah,\" said the poor widow--and the tear-drops gushed into her eyes as\\nshe said it--\"I have a boy, a darling son, somewhere on the face of the\\nwide world, unless Heaven has taken him away, and I only act toward you as\\nI would that others should act toward him. God, who sent manna from\\nheaven, can provide for us as he did for Israel; and how should I this\\nnight offend him, if my son should be a wanderer, destitute as you, and he\\nshould have provided for him a home, even poor as this, were I to turn you\\nunrelieved away!\"\\n\\n10. The widow ended, and the stranger, springing from his seat, clasped\\nher in his arms. \"God indeed has provided your son a home, and has given\\nhim wealth to reward the goodness of his benefactress: my mother! oh, my\\nmother!\" It was her long lost son, returned to her bosom from the Indies.\\nHe had chosen that disguise that he might the more completely surprise his\\nfamily; and never was surprise more perfect, or followed by a sweeter cup\\nof joy.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

ABOU BEN ADHEM.\\n\\nJames Henry Leigh Hunt (b. 1784, d. 1859) was the son of a West Indian,\\nwho married an American lady, and practiced law in Philadelphia until the\\nRevolution; being a Tory, he then returned to England, where Leigh Hunt\\nwas born. The latter wrote many verses while yet a boy, and in 1801 his\\nfather published a collection of them, entitled \"Juvenilia.\" For many\\nyears he was connected with various newspapers, and, while editor of the\\n\"Examiner,\" was imprisoned for two years for writing disrespectfully of\\nthe prince regent. While in prison he was visited frequently by the poets\\nByron, Moore, Lamb, Shelley, and Keats; and there wrote \"The Feast of the\\nPoets,\" \"The Descent of Liberty, a Mask,\" and \"The Story of Rimini,\" which\\nimmediately gave him a reputation as a poet. His writings include various\\ntranslations, dramas, novels, collections of essays, and poems.\\n\\n1. ABOU BEN ADHEM (may his tribe increase!)\\n   Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,\\n   And saw within the moonlight in his room,\\n   Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,\\n   An angel writing in a book of gold.\\n\\n2. Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold;\\n   And to the presence in the room he said,\\n   \"What writest thou?\" The vision raised its head,\\n   And, with a look made of all sweet accord,\\n   Answered, \"The names of those who love the Lord.\"\\n\\n3. \"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so,\"\\n   Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,\\n   But cheerly still; and said, \"I pray thee, then,\\n   Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.\"\\n\\n4. The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night\\n   It came again, with a great wakening light,\\n   And showed the names whom love of God had blessed;\\n   And, lo! Ben Adhem\\'s name led all the rest.\\n\\nNOTE.--The above selection is written in imitation of an\\noriental fable.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII. LUCY FORESTER.\\n\\nJohn Wilson (b. 1785, d. 1854), better known as \"Christopher North,\" was a\\ncelebrated author, poet, and critic, born at Paisley, Scotland, and\\neducated at the University of Glasgow and at Oxford. In 1808 he moved to\\nWestmoreland, England, where he formed one of the \"Lake School\" of poets.\\nWhile at Oxford he gained a prize for a poem on \"Painting, Poetry, and\\nArchitecture.\" In 1820 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy in the\\nUniversity of Edinburgh, which position he retained until 1851. He gained\\nhis greatest reputation as the chief author of \"Noctes Ambrosianae,\"\\nessays contributed to Blackwood\\'s Magazine between 1822 and 1825. Among\\nhis poems may be mentioned \"The Isle of Palms\" and the \"City of the\\nPlague,\" This selection is adapted from \"The Foresters,\" a tale of\\nScottish life.\\n\\n1. Lucy was only six years old, but bold as a fairy; she had gone by\\nherself a thousand times about the braes, and often upon errands to houses\\ntwo or three miles distant. What had her parents to fear? The footpaths\\nwere all firm, and led to no places of danger, nor are infants themselves\\nincautious when alone in then pastimes. Lucy went singing into the low\\nwoods, and singing she reappeared on the open hillside. With her small\\nwhite hand on the rail, she glided along the wooden bridge, or tripped\\nfrom stone to stone across the shallow streamlet.\\n\\n2. The creature would be away for hours, and no fear be felt on her\\naccount by anyone at home; whether she had gone, with her basket on her\\narm, to borrow some articles of household use from a neighbor, or, merely\\nfor her own solitary delight, had wandered off to the braes to play among\\nthe flowers, coming back laden with wreaths and garlands.\\n\\n3. The happy child had been invited to pass a whole day, from morning to\\nnight, at Ladyside (a farmhouse about two miles off) with her playmates\\nthe Maynes; and she left home about an hour after sunrise.\\n\\n4. During her absence, the house was silent but happy, and, the evening\\nbeing now far advanced, Lucy was expected home every minute, and Michael,\\nAgnes, and Isabel, her father, mother, and aunt, went to meet her on the\\nway. They walked on and on, wondering a little, but in no degree alarmed\\ntill they reached Ladyside, and heard the cheerful din of the children\\nwithin, still rioting at the close of the holiday. Jacob Mayne came to the\\ndoor, but, on their kindly asking why Lucy had not been sent home before\\ndaylight was over, he looked painfully surprised, and said that she had\\nnot been at Ladyside.\\n\\n5. Within two hours, a hundred persons were traversing the hills in all\\ndirections, even at a distance which it seemed most unlikely that poor\\nLucy could have reached. The shepherds and their dogs, all the night\\nthrough, searched every nook, every stony and rocky place, every piece of\\ntaller heather, every crevice that could conceal anything alive or dead:\\nbut no Lucy was there.\\n\\n6. Her mother, who for a while seemed inspired with supernatural strength,\\nhad joined in the search, and with a quaking heart looked into every\\nbrake, or stopped and listened to every shout and halloo reverberating\\namong the hills, intent to seize upon some tone of recognition or\\ndiscovery. But the moon sank; and then the stars, whose increased\\nbrightness had for a short time supplied her place, all faded away; and\\nthen came the gray dawn of the morning, and then the clear brightness of\\nthe day,--and still Michael and Agnes were childless.\\n\\n7. \"She has sunk into some mossy or miry place,\" said Michael, to a man\\nnear him, into whose face he could not look, \"a cruel, cruel death to one\\nlike her! The earth on which my child walked has closed over her, and we\\nshall never see her more!\"\\n\\n8. At last, a man who had left the search, and gone in a direction toward\\nthe highroad, came running with something in his arms toward the place\\nwhere Michael and others were standing beside Agnes, who lay, apparently\\nexhausted almost to dying, on the sward. He approached hesitatingly; and\\nMichael saw that he carried Lucy\\'s bonnet, clothes, and plaid.\\n\\n9. It was impossible not to see some spots of blood upon the frill that\\nthe child had worn around her neck. \"Murdered! murdered!\" was the one word\\nwhispered or ejaculated all around; but Agnes heard it not; for, worn out\\nby that long night of hope and despair, she had fallen asleep, and was,\\nperhaps, seeking her lost Lucy in her dreams.\\n\\n10. Isabel took the clothes, and, narrowly inspecting them with eye and\\nhand, said, with a fervent voice that was heard even in Michael\\'s despair,\\n\"No, Lucy is yet among the living. There are no marks of violence on the\\ngarments of the innocent; no murderer\\'s hand has been here. These blood\\nspots have been put here to deceive. Besides, would not the murderer have\\ncarried off these things? For what else would he have murdered her? But,\\noh! foolish despair! What speak I of? For, wicked as the world is--ay!\\ndesperately wicked--there is not, on all the surface of the wide earth, a\\nhand that would murder our child! Is it not plain as the sun in the\\nheaven, that Lucy has been stolen by some wretched gypsy beggar?\"\\n\\n11. The crowd quietly dispersed, and horse and foot began to scour the\\ncountry. Some took the highroads, others all the bypaths, and many the\\ntrackless hills. Now that they were in some measure relieved from the\\nhorrible belief that the child was dead, the worst other calamity seemed\\nnothing, for hope brought her back to their arms.\\n\\n12. Agnes had been able to walk home to Bracken-Braes, and Michael and\\nIsabel sat by her bedside. All her strength was gone, and she lay at the\\nmercy of the rustle of a leaf, or a shadow across the window. Thus hour\\nafter hour passed, till it was again twilight. \"I hear footsteps coming up\\nthe brae,\" said Agnes, who had for some time appeared to be slumbering;\\nand in a few moments the voice of Jacob Mayne was heard at the outer\\ndoor.\\n\\n13. Jacob wore a solemn expression of countenance, and he seemed, from his\\nlooks, to bring no comfort. Michael stood up between him and his wife, and\\nlooked into his heart. Something there seemed to be in his face that was\\nnot miserable. \"If he has heard nothing of my child,\" thought Michael,\\n\"this man must care little for his own fireside.\" \"Oh, speak, speak,\" said\\nAgnes; \"yet why need you speak? All this has been but a vain belief, and\\nLucy is in heaven.\"\\n\\n14. \"Something like a trace of her has been discovered; a woman, with a\\nchild that did not look like a child of hers, was last night at\\nClovenford, and left it at the dawning.\" \"Do you hear that, my beloved\\nAgnes?\" said Isabel; \"she will have tramped away with Lucy up into Ettrick\\nor Yarrow; but hundreds of eyes will have been upon her; for these are\\nquiet but not solitary glens; and the hunt will be over long before she\\nhas crossed down upon Hawick. I knew that country in my young days, What\\nsay you, Mr. Mayne? There is the light of hope in your face.\" \"There is no\\nreason to doubt, ma\\'am, that it was Lucy. Everybody is sure of it. If it\\nwas my own Rachel, I should have no fear as to seeing her this blessed\\nnight.\"\\n\\n15. Jacob Mayne now took a chair, and sat down, with even a smile upon his\\ncountenance. \"I may tell you now, that Watty Oliver knows it was your\\nchild, for he saw her limping along after the gypsy at Galla-Brigg; but,\\nhaving no suspicion, he did not take a second look at her,--but one look\\nis sufficient, and he swears it was bonny Lucy Forester.\"\\n\\n16. Aunt Isabel, by this time, had bread and cheese and a bottle of her\\nown elder-flower wine on the table. \"You have been a long and hard\\njourney, wherever you have been, Mr. Mayne; take some refreshment;\" and\\nMichael asked a blessing.\\n\\n17. Jacob saw that he might now venture to reveal the whole truth. \"No,\\nno, Mrs. Irving, I am over happy to eat or to drink. You are all prepared\\nfor the blessing that awaits you. Your child is not far off; and I myself,\\nfor it is I myself that found her, will bring her by the hand, and restore\\nher to her parents.\"\\n\\n18. Agnes had raised herself up in her bed at these words, but she sank\\ngently back on her pillow; aunt Isabel was rooted to her chair; and\\nMichael, as he rose up, felt as if the ground were sinking under his feet.\\nThere was a dead silence all around the house for a short space, and then\\nthe sound of many voices, which again by degrees subsided. The eyes of all\\nthen looked, and yet feared to look, toward the door.\\n\\n19. Jacob Mayne was not so good as his word, for he did not\\nbring Lucy by the hand to restore her to her parents; but dressed\\nagain in her own bonnet and gown, and her own plaid, in rushed\\ntheir own child, by herself, with tears and sobs of joy, and her\\nfather laid her within her mother\\'s bosom.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS.\\n\\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (b. 1807, d. 1882), the son of Hon. Stephen\\nLongfellow, an eminent lawyer, was born in Portland, Maine. He graduated\\nat Bowdoin College in 1825. After spending four years in Europe, he was\\nProfessor of Modern Languages and Literature at Bowdoin till 1835, when he\\nwas appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in\\nHarvard University. He resigned his professorship in 1854, after which\\ntime he resided in Cambridge, Mass. Longfellow wrote many original works\\nboth in verse and prose, and made several translations, the most famous of\\nwhich is that of the works of Dante. His poetry is always chaste and\\nelegant, showing traces of careful scholarship in every line. The numerous\\nand varied editions of his poems are evidences of their popularity.\\n\\n1. There is a Reaper whose name is Death,\\n     And, with his sickle keen,\\n   He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,\\n     And the flowers that grow between.\\n\\n2. \"Shall I have naught that is fair?\" saith he;\\n     \"Have naught but the bearded grain?\\n   Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,\\n     I will give them all back again.\"\\n\\n3. He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,\\n     He kissed their drooping leaves;\\n   It was for the Lord of Paradise\\n     He bound them in his sheaves.\\n\\n4. \"My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,\"\\n     The Reaper said, and smiled;\\n   \"Dear tokens of the earth are they,\\n     Where he was once a child.\\n\\n5. \"They shall all bloom in the fields of light,\\n     Transplanted by my care,\\n   And saints, upon their garments white,\\n     These sacred blossoms wear.\"\\n\\n6. And the mother gave in tears and pain\\n     The flowers she most did love;\\n   She knew she should find them all again\\n     In the fields of light above.\\n\\n7. O, not in cruelty, not in wrath,\\n     The Reaper came that day,\\n   \\'T was an angel visited the green earth,\\n     And took the flowers away.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Sheaves, bundles of grain. 4.

THE TOWN PUMP.\\n\\nNathaniel Hawthorne (b.1804, d.1864) was born in Salem, Mass. He graduated\\nat Bowdoin College in 1825. His earliest literary productions, written for\\nperiodicals, were published in two volumes--the first in 1837, the second\\nin 1842--under the title of \"Twice-Told Tales,\" \"Mosses from an Old\\nManse,\" another series of tales and sketches, was published in 1845. From\\n1846 to 1850 he was surveyor of the port of Salem. In 1852 he was\\nappointed United States consul for Liverpool. After holding this office\\nfour years, he traveled for some time on the continent. His most popular\\nworks are \"The Scarlet Letter,\" a work showing a deep knowledge of human\\nnature, \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" \"The Blithedale Romance.\" and\\n\"The Marble Faun,\" an Italian romance, which is regarded by many as the\\nbest of his works. Being of a modest and retiring disposition, Mr.\\nHawthorne avoided publicity. Most of his works are highly imaginative. As\\na prose writer he has no superior among American authors. He died at\\nPlymouth, N. H., while on a visit to the White Mountains for his health.\\n\\n[SCENE.--The corner of two principal streets. The Town Pump\\ntalking through its nose.]\\n\\n1. Noon, by the north clock! Noon, by the east! High noon, too, by those\\nhot sunbeams which fall, scarcely aslope, upon my head, and almost make\\nthe water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose. Truly, we public\\ncharacters have a tough time of it! And among all the town officers,\\nchosen at the yearly meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single\\nyear, the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity,\\nupon the Town Pump?\\n\\n2. The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine, as guardian of the best\\ntreasure the town has. The overseers of the poor ought to make me their\\nchairman, since I provide bountifully for the pauper, without expense to\\nhim that pays taxes. I am at the head of the fire department, and one of\\nthe physicians of the board of health. As a keeper or the peace, all water\\ndrinkers confess me equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties\\nof the town clerk, by promulgating public notices, when they are pasted on\\nmy front.\\n\\n3. To speak within bounds, I am chief person of the municipality, and\\nexhibit, moreover, an admirable pattern to my brother officers by the\\ncool, steady, upright, downright, and impartial discharge of my business,\\nand the constancy with which I stand to my post. Summer or winter, nobody\\nseeks me in vain; for all day long I am seen at the busiest corner, just\\nabove the market, stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike; and at\\nnight I hold a lantern over my head, to show where I am, and to keep\\npeople out of the gutters.\\n\\n4. At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace, for\\nwhose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist Like a dramseller on\\nthe public square, on a muster day, I cry aloud to all and sundry, in my\\nplainest accents, and at the very tiptop of my voice. \"Here it is,\\ngentlemen! Here is the good liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up,\\nwalk up! Here is the superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated ale of\\nfather Adam! better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine\\nof any price; here it is, by the hogshead or the single glass, and not a\\ncent to pay. Walk up, gentlemen, walk up and help yourselves!\"\\n\\n5. It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here they\\ncome. A hot day, gentlemen. Quaff and away again, so as to keep yourselves\\nin a nice, cool sweat. You, my friend, will need another cupful to wash\\nthe dust out of your throat, if it be as thick there as it is on your\\ncowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half a score of miles to-day,\\nand, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at the\\nrunning brooks and well curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without and fire\\nwithin, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or melted down to nothing\\nat all--in the fashion of a jellyfish.\\n\\n6. Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to quench\\nthe fiery fever of last night\\'s potations, which he drained from no cup of\\nmine. Welcome, most rubicund sir! You and I have been strangers hitherto;\\nnor, to confess the truth, will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy,\\ntill the fumes of your breath be a little less potent.\\n\\n7. Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses down your red-hot\\ngullet, and is converted quite into steam in the miniature Tophet, which\\nyou mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an\\nhonest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any other kind of\\ndramshop, spend the price of your children\\'s food for a swig half so\\ndelicious? Now, for the first time these ten years, you know the flavor of\\ncold water. Good-by; and whenever you are thirsty, recollect that I keep a\\nconstant supply at the old stand.\\n\\n8. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let loose from school, and\\ncome hither to scrub your blooming face, and drown the memory of certain\\ntaps of the ferule, and other schoolboy troubles, in a draught from the\\nTown Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young life; take it, and\\nmay your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than\\nnow.\\n\\n9. There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield your place to this\\nelderly gentleman, who treads so tenderly over the paving stones that I\\nsuspect he is afraid of breaking them. What! he limps by without so much\\nas thanking me, as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who\\nhave no wine cellars.\\n\\n10. Well, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw the cork, tip the\\ndecanter; but when your great toe shall set you a-roaring, it will be no\\naffair of mine. If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout, it\\nis all one to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red tongue lolling\\nout, does not scorn my hospitality, but stands on his hind legs, and laps\\neagerly out of the trough. See how lightly he capers away again! Jowler,\\ndid your worship ever have the gout?\\n\\n11. Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my stream of eloquence, and\\nspout forth a stream of water to replenish the trough for this teamster\\nand his two yoke of oxen, who have come all the way from Staunton, or\\nsomewhere along that way. No part of my business gives me more pleasure\\nthan the watering of cattle. Look! how rapidly they lower the watermark on\\nthe sides of the trough, till their capacious stomachs are moistened with\\na gallon or two apiece, and they can afford time to breathe, with sighs of\\ncalm enjoyment! Now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their\\nmonstrous drinking vessel. An ox is your true toper.\\n\\n12. I hold myself the grand reformer of the age. From my spout, and such\\nspouts as mine, must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of a\\nvast portion of its crime and anguish, which have gushed from the fiery\\nfountains of the still. In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall be my\\ngreat confederate. Milk and water!\\n\\n13. Ahem! Dry work this speechifying, especially to all unpracticed\\norators. I never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers\\nundergo for my sake. Do, some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just\\nto wet my whistle. Thank you, sir. But to proceed.\\n\\n14. The Town Pump and the Cow! Such is the glorious partnership that shall\\nfinally monopolize the whole business of quenching thirst. Blessed\\nconsummation! Then Poverty shall pass away from the land, finding no hovel\\nso wretched where her squalid form may shelter itself. Then Disease, for\\nlack of other victims, shall gnaw his own heart and die. Then Sin, if she\\ndo not die, shall lose half her strength.\\n\\n15. Then there will be no war of households. The husband and the wife,\\ndrinking deep of peaceful joy, a calm bliss of temperate affections, shall\\npass hand in hand through life, and lie down, not reluctantly, at its\\nprotracted close. To them the past will be no turmoil of mad dreams, nor\\nthe future an eternity of such moments as follow the delirium of a\\ndrunkard. Their dead faces shall express what their spirits were, and are\\nto be, by a lingering smile of memory and hope.\\n\\n16. Drink, then, and be refreshed! The water is as pure and cold as when\\nit slaked the thirst of the red hunter, and flowed beneath the aged bough,\\nthough now this gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot stones,\\nwhere no shadow falls, but from the brick buildings.

GOOD NIGHT.\\n\\nSamuel Griswold Goodrich (b. 1793, d. 1860) was born in Ridgefield, Conn.\\nMr. Goodrich is best known as \"Peter Parley,\" under which assumed name he\\ncommenced the publication of a series of Juvenile works about 1827. He\\nedited \"Parley\\'s Magazine\" from 1841 to 1854. He was appointed United\\nStates consul for Paris in 1848, and held that office four years. He was a\\nvoluminous writer, and his works are interesting and popular. His\\n\"Recollections of a Lifetime\" was published in 1857, and \"Peter Parley\\'s\\nOwn Story\" the year after his death.\\n\\n1.

AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL.\\n\\nLouisa May Alcott (b. 1833, d. 1888) was born at Germantown, Pa., of New\\nEngland parentage. Her parents afterwards returned to New England, and\\nmost of her life was spent in Concord, Mass. During the Civil War she went\\nto Washington and nursed the wounded and sick until her own health gave\\nway. As a child she used to write stories for the amusement of her\\nplaymates, and in 1857 published her first book, \"Flower Fables.\" Her\\nfirst novel, \"Moods,\" appeared in 1865. \"Little Women,\" published in 1868,\\nis a picture of her own home life. \"An Old Fashioned Girl,\" from which\\nthis extract is adapted, was published in 1870, and is one of her most\\npopular books.\\n\\n1. Polly hoped the \"dreadful boy\" (Tom) would not be present; but he was,\\nand stared at her all dinner time in a most trying manner.\\n\\n2. Mr. Shaw, a busy-looking gentleman, said, \"How do you do, my dear? Hope\\nyou\\'ll enjoy yourself;\" and then appeared to forget her entirely. Mrs.\\nShaw, a pale, nervous woman, greeted her little guest kindly, and took\\ncare that she wanted for nothing.\\n\\n3. Madam Shaw, a quiet old lady, with an imposing cap, exclaimed, on\\nseeing Polly, \"Bless my heart! the image of her mother--a sweet woman--how\\nis she, dear?\" and kept peering at the newcomer over her glasses till,\\nbetween Madam and Tom, poor Polly lost her appetite.\\n\\n4. Her cousin Fanny chatted like a magpie, and little Maud fidgeted, till\\nTom proposed to put her under the big dish cover, which produced such an\\nexplosion that the young lady was borne screaming away by the\\nmuch-enduring nurse.\\n\\n5. It was, altogether, an uncomfortable dinner, and Polly was very glad\\nwhen it was over. They all went about their own affairs; and, after doing\\nthe honors of the house, Fan was called to the dressmaker, leaving Polly\\nto amuse herself in the great drawing-room.\\n\\n6. Polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes; and, having examined all\\nthe pretty things about her, began to walk up and down over the soft,\\nflowery carpet, humming to herself, as the daylight faded, and only the\\nruddy glow of the fire filled the room.\\n\\n7. Presently Madam came slowly in, and sat down in her armchair, saying,\\n\"That\\'s a fine old tune; sing it to me, my dear. I have n\\'t heard it this\\nmany a day.\"\\n\\n8. Polly did n\\'t like to sing before strangers, for she had no teaching\\nbut such as her busy mother could give her; but she had been taught the\\nutmost respect for old people, and, having no reason for refusing, she\\ndirectly went to the piano and did as she was bid.\\n\\n9. \"That\\'s the sort of music it\\'s a pleasure to hear. Sing some more,\\ndear,\" said Madam, in her gentle way, when she had done.\\n\\n10. Pleased with this praise, Polly sang away in a fresh little voice that\\nwent straight to the listener\\'s heart and nestled there. The sweet old\\ntunes that one is never tired of were all Polly\\'s store. The more she\\nsung, the better she did it; and when she wound up with \"A Health to King\\nCharlie,\" the room quite rung with the stirring music made by the big\\npiano and the little maid.\\n\\n11. \"That\\'s a jolly tune! Sing it again, please,\" cried Tom\\'s voice; and\\nthere was Tom\\'s red head bobbing up over the high back of the chair where\\nhe had hidden himself.\\n\\n12. It gave Polly quite a turn, for she thought no one was hearing her but\\nthe old lady dozing by the fire. \"I can\\'t sing any more; I\\'m tired,\" she\\nsaid, and walked away to Madam in the other room. The red head vanished\\nlike a meteor, for Polly\\'s tone had been decidedly cool.\\n\\n13. The old lady put out her hand, and, drawing Polly to her knee, looked\\ninto her face with such kind eyes that Polly forgot the impressive cap,\\nand smiled at her confidently; for she saw that her simple music had\\npleased her listener, and she felt glad to know it.\\n\\n14. \"You mus\\'n\\'t mind my staring, dear,\" said Madam, softly pinching her\\nrosy cheek, \"I haven\\'t seen a little girl for so long, it does my old eyes\\ngood to look at you.\" Polly thought that a very odd speech, and could n\\'t\\nhelp saying, \"Are n\\'t Fan and Maud little girls, too?\"\\n\\n15. \"Oh, dear, no! not what I call little girls. Fan has been a young lady\\nthis two years, and Maud is a spoiled baby. Your mother\\'s a very sensible\\nwoman, my child.\"\\n\\n16. \"What a queer old lady!\" thought Polly; but she said \"Yes\\'m,\"\\nrespectfully, and looked at the fire. \"You don\\'t understand what I mean,\\ndo you?\" asked Madam, still holding her by the chin. \"No\\'m; not quite.\"\\n\\n17. \"Well, dear, I\\'ll tell you. In my day, children of fourteen and\\nfifteen did n\\'t dress in the height of the fashion; go to parties as\\nnearly like those of grown people as it\\'s possible to make them; lead\\nidle, giddy, unhealthy lives, and get blase\\' at twenty. We were little\\nfolks till eighteen or so; worked and studied, dressed and played, like\\nchildren; honored our parents; and our days were much longer in the land\\nthan now, it seems to me.\"\\n\\n18. The old lady appeared to forget Polly, at the end of her speech; for\\nshe sat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own, and looking up\\nat a faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt and a queue.\\n\"Was he your father, Madam?\"\\n\\n19. \"Yes, my dear; my honored father. I did up his frills to the day of\\nhis death; and the first money I ever earned, was five dollars which he\\noffered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the handsomest\\ndarn in his silk stockings.\"\\n\\n20. \"How proud you must have been!\" cried Polly, leaning on the old lady\\'s\\nknee with an interested face.\\n\\n21. \"Yes; and we all learned to make bread, and cook, and wore little\\nchintz gowns, and were as gay and hearty as kittens. All lived to be\\ngrandmothers; and I\\'m the last--seventy next birthday, my dear, and not\\nworn out yet; though daughter Shaw is an invalid at forty.\"\\n\\n22. \"That\\'s the way I was brought up, and that\\'s why Fan calls me\\nold-fashioned, I suppose. Tell more about your papa, please; I like it,\"\\nsaid Polly.\\n\\n23. \"Say, \\'father.\\' We never called him papa; and if one of my brothers\\nhad addressed him as \\'governor,\\' as boys now do, I really think he\\'d have\\nhim cut off with a shilling.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Im-pos\\'ing, having the power of exciting attention and\\nfeeling, impressive. 4. Mag\\'pie, a noisy, mischievous bird, common in\\nEurope and America. 12. Van\\'ished, disappeared. Me\\'te-or, a shooting star.\\n13. Con\\'fi-dent-ly, with trust. 17. Bla-se\\' (pro. bla-za\\'), a French word\\nmeaning surfeited, rendered incapable further enjoyment. 21. In\\'va-lid, a\\nperson who is sickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXII. MY MOTHER\\'S HANDS.\\n\\n1. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!\\n     They\\'re neither white nor small;\\n   And you, I know, would scarcely think\\n     That they are fair at all.\\n   I\\'ve looked on hands whose form and hue\\n     A sculptor\\'s dream might be;\\n   Yet are those aged, wrinkled hands\\n     More beautiful to me.\\n\\n2. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!\\n     Though heart were weary and sad,\\n   Those patient hands kept toiling on,\\n     That the children might be glad.\\n   I always weep, as, looking back\\n     To childhood\\'s distant day,\\n   I think how those hands rested not\\n     When mine were at their play.\\n\\n3. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!\\n     They\\'re growing feeble now,\\n   For time and pain have left their mark\\n     On hands and heart and brow.\\n   Alas! alas! the nearing time,\\n     And the sad, sad day to me,\\n   When \\'neath the daisies, out of sight,\\n     These hands will folded be.\\n\\n4. But oh! beyond this shadow land,\\n     Where all is bright and fair,\\n   I know full well these dear old hands\\n     Will palms of victory bear;\\n   Where crystal streams through endless years\\n     Flow over golden sands,\\n   And where the old grow young again,\\n     I\\'ll clasp my mother\\'s hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIII. THE DISCONTENTED PENDULUM.\\n\\nJane Taylor (b. 1783, d. 1824) was born in London. Her mother was a writer\\nof some note. In connection with her sister Ann, Jane Taylor wrote several\\njuvenile works of more than ordinary excellence. Among them were \"Hymns\\nfor Infant Minds\" and \"Original Poems.\" Besides these, she wrote \"Display,\\na Tale,\" \"Essays in Rhyme,\" and \"Contributions of QQ.\" Her writings are\\ngraceful, and often contain a useful moral.\\n\\n1. An old dock that had stood for fifty years in a farmer\\'s kitchen,\\nwithout giving its owner any cause of complaint, early one summer\\'s\\nmorning, before the family was stirring, suddenly stopped. Upon this, the\\ndial plate (if we may credit the fable) changed countenance with alarm;\\nthe hands made a vain effort to continue their course; the wheels remained\\nmotionless with surprise; the weights hung speechless; and each member\\nfelt disposed to lay the blame on the others. At length the dial\\ninstituted a formal inquiry as to the cause of the stagnation, when hands,\\nwheels, weights, with one voice, protested their innocence.\\n\\n2. But now a faint tick was heard below from the pendulum, who spoke thus:\\n\"I confess myself to be the sole cause of the present stoppage; and I am\\nwilling, for the general satisfaction, to assign my reasons. The truth is,\\nthat I am tired of ticking.\" Upon hearing this, the old clock became so\\nenraged that it was upon the very point of striking. \"Lazy wire!\"\\nexclaimed the dial plate, holding up its bands.\\n\\n3. \"Very good!\" replied the pendulum; \"it is vastly easy for you, Mistress\\nDial, who have always, as everybody knows, set yourself up above me,--it\\nis vastly easy for you, I say, to accuse other people of laziness! you who\\nhave had nothing to do all your life but to stare people in the face, and\\nto amuse yourself with watching all that goes on in the kitchen. Think, I\\nbeseech you, how you would like to be shut up for life in this dark\\ncloset, and to wag backward and forward year after year, as I do.\"\\n\\n4. \"As to that,\" said the dial, \"is there not a window in your house on\\npurpose for you to look through?\" \"For all that,\" resumed the pendulum,\\n\"it is very dark here; and, although there is a window, I dare not stop\\neven for an instant to look out at it. Besides, I am really tired of my\\nway of life; and, if you wish, I\\'ll tell you how I took this disgust at my\\nemployment. I happened, this morning, to be calculating how many times I\\nshould have to tick in the course of only the next twenty-four hours;\\nperhaps some one of you above there can give me the exact sum.\"\\n\\n5. The minute hand, being quick at figures, presently replied, \"Eighty-six\\nthousand four hundred times.\" \"Exactly so,\" replied the pendulum. \"Well, I\\nappeal to you all, if the very thought of this was not enough to fatigue\\nanyone; and when I began to multiply the strokes of one day by those of\\nmonths and years, really it was no wonder if I felt discouraged at the\\nprospect. So, after a great deal of reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to\\nmyself, I\\'ll stop.\"\\n\\n6. The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this harangue; but,\\nresuming its gravity, thus replied: \"Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really\\nastonished that such a useful, industrious person as yourself should have\\nbeen seized by this sudden weariness. It is true, you have done a great\\ndeal of work in your time; so have we all, and are likely to do; which,\\nalthough it may fatigue us to think of, the question is, whether it will\\nfatigue us to do. Would you now do me the favor to give about half a dozen\\nstrokes to illustrate my argument?\"\\n\\n7. The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its usual pace. \"Now,\"\\nresumed the dial, \"may I be allowed to inquire if that exertion is at all\\nfatiguing or disagreeable to you?\" \"Not in the least,\" replied the\\npendulum; \"it is not of six strokes that I complain, nor of sixty, but of\\nmillions.\"\\n\\n8. \"Very good,\" replied the dial; \"but recollect that, although\\nyou may think of a million of strokes in an instant, you are\\nrequired to execute but one; and that, however often you may\\nhereafter have to swing, a moment will always be given you to\\nswing in.\" \"That consideration staggers me, I confess,\" said the\\npendulum. \"Then I hope,\" resumed the dial plate, \"that we shall all\\nreturn to our duty immediately; for the maids will be in bed if we\\nstand idling thus.\"\\n\\n9. Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused of light conduct,\\nused all their influence in urging him to proceed; when, as if with one\\nconsent, the wheels began to turn, the hands began to move, the pendulum\\nbegan to swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a red\\nbeam of the rising sun, that streamed through a hole in the kitchen,\\nshining full upon the dial plate, it brightened up as if nothing had been\\nthe matter.\\n\\n10. When the farmer came down to breakfast that morning, upon looking at\\nthe clock, he declared that his watch had gained half an hour in the\\nnight.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. In\\'sti-tut-ed, commenced, began. Pro-test\\'ed, solemnly\\ndeclared. 4. Cal\\'cu-lat-ing, reckoning, computing. 5. Pros\\'pect,\\nanticipation, that to which one looks forward. 6.

Con-sid-er-a\\'tion, reason.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIV. THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS.\\n\\nWilliam Cullen Bryant (b. 1794, d. 1878) was born in Cummington, Mass. He\\nentered Williams College at the age of sixteen, but was honorably\\ndismissed at the end of two years. At the age of twenty-one he was\\nadmitted to the bar, and practiced his profession successfully for nine\\nyears. In 1826 he removed to New York, and became connected with the\\n\"Evening Post\"--a connection which continued to the time of his death. His\\nresidence for more than thirty of the last years of his life was at\\nRoslyn, Long Island. He visited Europe several times; and in 1849 he\\ncontinued his travels into Egypt and Syria, In all his poems, Mr. Bryant\\nexhibits a remarkable love for, and a careful study of, nature. His\\nlanguage, both in prose and verse, is always chaste, correct, and elegant.\\n\"Thanatopsis,\" perhaps the best known of all his poems, was written when\\nhe was but nineteen. His excellent translations of the \"Iliad\" and the\\n\"Odyssey\" of Homer and some of his best poems, were written after he had\\npassed the age of seventy. He retained his powers and his activity till\\nthe close of his life.\\n\\n1. The melancholy days are come,\\n     The saddest of the year,\\n   Of wailing winds, and naked woods,\\n     And meadows brown and sear.\\n   Heaped in the hollows of the grove\\n     The autumn leaves lie dead;\\n   They rustle to the eddying gust,\\n     And to the rabbit\\'s tread.\\n   The robin and the wren are flown,\\n     And from the shrubs the jay,\\n   And from the wood top calls the crow\\n     Through all the gloomy day.\\n\\n2. Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers,\\n     That lately sprang and stood\\n   In brighter light and softer airs,\\n     A beauteous sisterhood?\\n   Alas! they all are in their graves;\\n     The gentle race of flowers\\n   Are lying in their lowly beds\\n     With the fair and good of ours.\\n   The rain is falling where they lie;\\n     But the cold November rain\\n   Calls not from out the gloomy earth\\n     The lovely ones again.\\n\\n3. The windflower and the violet,\\n     They perished long ago,\\n   And the brier rose and the orchis died\\n     Amid the summer\\'s glow;\\n   But on the hill, the golden-rod,\\n     And the aster in the wood,\\n   And the yellow sunflower by the brook,\\n     In autumn beauty stood,\\n   Till fell the frost from the clear, cold heaven,\\n     As falls the plague on men,\\n   And the brightness of their smile was gone\\n     From upland, glade, and glen,\\n\\n4. And now, when comes the calm, mild day,\\n     As still such days will come,\\n   To call the squirrel and the bee\\n     From out their winter home;\\n   When the sound of dropping nuts is heard,\\n     Though all the trees are still,\\n   And twinkle in the smoky light\\n     The waters of the rill,\\n   The south wind searches for the flowers\\n     Whose fragrance late he bore,\\n   And sighs to find them in the wood\\n     And by the stream no more.\\n\\n5. And then I think of one, who in\\n     Her youthful beauty died,\\n   The fair, meek blossom that grew up\\n     And faded by my side.\\n   In the cold, moist earth we laid her,\\n     When the forest cast the leaf,\\n   And we wept that one so lovely\\n     Should have a life so brief;\\n   Yet not unmeet it was that one,\\n     Like that young friend of ours,\\n   So gentle and so beautiful,\\n     Should perish with the flowers.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Wail\\'ing, lamenting, mourning. Sear, dry, withered. 3.\\nGlade, an open place in the forest. Glen, a valley, a dale. 4. Un-meet\\',\\nimproper, unfitting.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXV. THE THUNDERSTORM.\\n\\nWashington Irving (b. 1783, d. 1859). This distinguished author, whose\\nworks have enriched American literature, was born in the city of New York.\\nHe had an ordinary school education, and began his literary career at the\\nage of nineteen, by writing for a paper published by his brother. His\\nfirst book, \"Salmagundi,\" was published in 1807. Two years later he\\npublished \"Knickerbocker\\'s History of New York.\" In 1815 he sailed for\\nEurope, and remained abroad seventeen years, during which time he wrote\\nseveral of his works. From 1842 to 1846 he was minister to Spain. The last\\nyears of his life were passed at \"Sunnyside,\" near Tarrytown, N.Y. He was\\nnever married. \"The Life of Washington,\" his last work, was completed in\\nthe same year in which he died. Mr. Irving\\'s works are characterized by\\nhumor, chaste sentiment, and elegance and correctness of expression. The\\nfollowing selection is from \"Dolph\" in \"Bracehridge Hall.\"\\n\\n1. In the second day of the voyage, they came to the Highlands. It was the\\nlatter part of a calm, sultry day, that they floated gently with the tide\\nbetween these stern mountains. There was that perfect quiet which prevails\\nover nature in the languor of summer heat. The turning of a plank, or the\\naccidental falling of an oar, on deck, was echoed from the mountain side\\nand reverberated along the shores; and, if by chance the captain gave a\\nshout of command, there were airy tongues that mocked it from every cliff.\\n\\n\\n2. Dolph gazed about him, in mute delight and wonder, at these scenes of\\nnature\\'s magnificence. To the left, the Dunderberg reared its woody\\nprecipices, height over height, forest over forest, away into the deep\\nsummer sky. To the right, strutted forth the bold promontory of Antony\\'s\\nNose, with a solitary eagle wheeling about it; while beyond, mountain\\nsucceeded to mountain, until they seemed to lock their arms together and\\nconfine this mighty rive in their embraces.\\n\\n3. In the midst of this admiration, Dolph remarked a pile of bright, snowy\\nclouds peering above the western heights. It was succeeded by another, and\\nanother, each seemingly pushing onward its predecessor, and towering, with\\ndazzling brilliancy, in the deep blue atmosphere; and now muttering peals\\nof thunder were faintly heard rolling behind the mountains. The river,\\nhitherto still and glassy, reflecting pictures of the sky and land, now\\nshowed a dark ripple at a distance, as the wind came creeping up it. The\\nfishhawks wheeled and screamed, and sought their nests on the high, dry\\ntrees; the crows flew clamorously to the crevices of the rocks; and all\\nnature seemed conscious of the approaching thunder gust.\\n\\n4. The clouds now rolled in volumes over the mountain tops; their summits\\nstill bright and snowy, but the lower parts of an inky blackness. The rain\\nbegan to patter down in broad and scattered drops; the wind freshened, and\\ncurled up the waves; at length, it seemed as if the bellying clouds were\\ntorn open by the mountain tops, and complete torrents of rain came\\nrattling down. The lightning leaped from cloud to cloud, and streamed\\nquivering against the rocks, splitting and rending the stoutest forest\\ntrees. The thunder burst in tremendous explosions; the peals were echoed\\nfrom mountain to mountain; they crashed upon Dunderberg, and then rolled\\nup the long defile of the Highlands, each headland making a new echo,\\nuntil old Bull Hill seemed to bellow back the storm.\\n\\n5. For a time the scudding rack and mist and the sheeted rain almost hid\\nthe landscape from the sight. There was a fearful gloom, illumined still\\nmore fearfully by the streams of lightning which glittered among the\\nraindrops. Never had Dolph beheld such an absolute warring of the\\nelements; it seemed as if the storm was tearing and rending its way\\nthrough the mountain defile, and had brought all the artillery of heaven\\ninto action.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Lan\\'guor (pro. lang\\'gwer), exhaustion of strength,\\ndullness. 3. Re-marked\\', noticed, observed. Pred-e-ces\\'-sor, the one going\\nimmediately before. Clam\\'or-ous-ly, with a loud noise. 4. Bel\\'ly-ing,\\nswelling out. De-file\\', a long, narrow pass. 5. Rack, thin, flying, broken\\nclouds. El\\'e-ments, a term usually including fire, water, earth, and air.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--1. The Highlands are a mountainous region in New York, bordering\\nthe Hudson River above Peekskill.\\n\\n2. The Dunderberg and Antony\\'s Nose are names of two peaks of the\\nHighlands.\\n\\n4. Bull Hill, also called Mt. Taurus, is 15 miles farther north.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXVI. APRIL DAY.\\n\\nCaroline Anne Southey (b. 1786, d.1854), the second wife of Southey the\\npoet, and better known as Caroline Bowles, was born near Lymington,\\nHampshire, England. Her first work, \"Ellen Fitzarthur,\" a poem, was\\npublished in 1820; and for more than twenty years her writings were\\npublished anonymously. In 1839 she was married to Mr. Southey, and\\nsurvived him over ten years. Her poetry is graceful in expression, and\\nfull of tenderness, though somewhat melancholy. The following extract\\nfirst appeared in 1822 in a collection entitled, \"The Widow\\'s Tale, and\\nother Poems.\"\\n\\n1. All day the low-hung clouds have dropped\\n     Their garnered fullness down;\\n   All day that soft, gray mist hath wrapped\\n     Hill, valley, grove, and town.\\n\\n2. There has not been a sound to-day\\n     To break the calm of nature;\\n   Nor motion, I might almost say,\\n     Of life or living creature;\\n\\n3. Of waving bough, or warbling bird,\\n     Or cattle faintly lowing;\\n   I could have half believed I heard\\n     The leaves and blossoms growing.\\n\\n4. I stood to hear--I love it well--\\n     The rain\\'s continuous sound;\\n   Small drops, but thick and fast they fell,\\n     Down straight into the ground.\\n\\n5. For leafy thickness is not yet\\n     Earth\\'s naked breast to screen,\\n   Though every dripping branch is set\\n     With shoots of tender green.\\n\\n6. Sure, since I looked, at early morn,\\n     Those honeysuckle buds\\n   Have swelled to double growth; that thorn\\n     Hath put forth larger studs.\\n\\n7. That lilac\\'s cleaving cones have burst,\\n     The milk-white flowers revealing;\\n   Even now upon my senses first\\n     Methinks their sweets are stealing.\\n\\n8. The very earth, the steamy air,\\n     Is all with fragrance rife!\\n   And grace and beauty everywhere\\n     Are flushing into life.\\n\\n9. Down, down they come, those fruitful stores,\\n     Those earth-rejoicing drops!\\n   A momentary deluge pours,\\n     Then thins, decreases, stops.\\n\\n10. And ere the dimples on the stream\\n      Have circled out of sight,\\n    Lo! from the west a parting gleam\\n      Breaks forth of amber light.\\n\\n* * * * * * *\\n\\n11. But yet behold--abrupt and loud,\\n      Comes down the glittering rain;\\n    The farewell of a passing cloud,\\n      The fringes of its train.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Gar\\'nered, laid up, treasured. 6. Studs, knobs, buds. 7.\\nCleav\\'ing, dividing. 10. Dim\\'ples, small depressions. Am\\'ber, the color of\\namber, yellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXVII. THE TEA ROSE.\\n\\n1. There it stood, in its little green vase, on a light ebony stand in the\\nwindow of the drawing-room. The rich satin curtains, with their costly\\nfringes, swept down on either side of it, and around it glittered every\\nrare and fanciful trifle which wealth can offer to luxury, and yet that\\nsimple rose was the fairest of them all. So pure it looked, its white\\nleaves just touched with that delicious, creamy tint peculiar to its kind:\\nits cup so full, so perfect its head bending, as if it were sinking and\\nmelting away in its own richness.--Oh! when did ever man make anything to\\nequal the living, perfect flower!\\n\\n2. But the sunlight that streamed through the window    revealed something\\nfairer than the rose--a young lady reclining on an ottoman, who was thus\\naddressed by her livelier cousin: \"I say, cousin, I have been thinking\\nwhat you are to do with your pet rose when you go to New York; as, to our\\nconsternation, you are determined to do. You know it would be a sad pity\\nto leave it with such a scatter-brain as I am. I love flowers,\\nindeed,--that is, I like a regular bouquet, cut off and tied up, to carry\\nto a party; but as to all this tending and fussing which is needful to\\nkeep them growing, I have no gifts in that line.\"\\n\\n3. \"Make yourself easy as to that, Kate,\" said Florence, with a\\nsmile; \"I have no intention of calling upon your talent; I have an\\nasylum in view for my favorite.\"\\n\\n4. \"Oh, then you know just what I was going to say. Mrs. Marshall, I\\npresume, has been speaking to you; she was here yesterday, and I was quite\\npathetic upon the subject; telling her the loss your favorite would\\nsustain, and so forth; and she said how delighted she would be to have it\\nin her greenhouse; it is in such a fine state now, so full of buds. I told\\nher I knew you would like to give it to her; you are so fond of Mrs.\\nMarshall, you know.\"\\n\\n5. \"Now, Kate, I am sorry, but I have otherwise engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Whom can it be to? you have so few intimates here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it is only one of my odd fancies.\"\\n\\n\"But do tell me, Florence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, cousin, you know the little pale girl to whom we give sewing?\"\\n\\n6. \"What! little Mary Stephens? How absurd, Florence! This is just another\\nof your motherly, old-maidish ways; dressing dolls for poor children,\\nmaking bonnets, and knitting socks for all the little dirty babies in the\\nneighborhood. I do believe you have made more calls in those two vile,\\nill-smelling alleys behind our house than ever you have in Chestnut\\nStreet, though you know everybody is half dying to see you; and now, to\\ncrown all, you must give this choice little bijou to a seamstress girl,\\nwhen one of your most intimate friends, in your own class, would value it\\nso highly. What in the world can people in their circumstances want with\\nflowers?\"\\n\\n7. \"Just the same as I do,\" replied Florence, calmly. \"Have you not\\nnoticed that the little girl never comes without looking wistfully at the\\nopening buds? And don\\'t you remember, the other morning she asked me so\\nprettily if I would let her mother come and see it, she was so fond of\\nflowers?\"\\n\\n8. \"But, Florence, only think of this rare flower standing on a table with\\nham, eggs, cheese, and flour, and stifled in that close little room, where\\nMrs. Stephens and her daughter manage to wash, iron, and cook.\"\\n\\n9. \"Well, Kate, and if I were obliged to live in one coarse room, and\\nwash, and iron, and cook, as you say; if I had to spend every moment of my\\ntime in toil, with no prospect from my window but a brick wall and a dirty\\nlane, such a flower as this would be untold enjoyment to me.\"\\n\\n10. \"Pshaw, Florence; all sentiment! Poor people have no time to be\\nsentimental. Besides, I don\\'t believe it will grow with them; it is a\\ngreenhouse flower, and used to delicate living.\"\\n\\n11. \"Oh, as to that, a flower never inquires whether its owner is rich or\\npoor; and poor Mrs. Stephens, whatever else she has not, has sunshine of\\nas good quality as this that streams through our window. The beautiful\\nthings that God makes are his gifts to all alike. You will see that my\\nfair rose will be as well and cheerful in Mrs. Stephens\\'s room as in\\nours.\"\\n\\n12. \"Well, after all, how odd! When one gives to poor people, one wants to\\ngive them something useful--a bushel of potatoes, a ham, and such things.\"\\n\\n13. \"Why, certainly, potatoes and ham must be supplied; but, having\\nministered to the first and most craving wants, why not add any other\\nlittle pleasures or gratifications we may have it in our power to bestow?\\nI know there are many of the poor who have fine feeling and a keen sense\\nof the beautiful, which rusts out and dies because they are too hard\\npressed to procure it any gratification. Poor Mrs. Stephens, for example;\\nI know she would enjoy birds, and flowers, and music as much as I do. I\\nhave seen her eye light up as she looked upon these things in our drawing.\\nroom, and yet not one beautiful thing can she command. From necessity, her\\nroom, her clothing,--all she has, must be coarse and plain. You should\\nhave seen the almost rapture she and Mary felt when I offered them my\\nrose.\"\\n\\n14. \"Dear me! all this may be true, but I never thought of it before. I\\nnever thought that these hard-working people had any ideas of taste!\"\\n\\n15. \"Then why do you see the geranium or rose so carefully nursed in the\\nold cracked teapot in the poorest room, or the morning-glory planted in a\\nbox and twined about the window? Do not these show that the human heart\\nyearns for the beautiful in all ranks of life? You remember, Kate, how our\\nwasherwoman sat up a whole night, after a hard day\\'s work, to make her\\nfirst baby a pretty dress to be baptized in.\" \"Yes, and I remember how I\\nlaughed at you for making such a tasteful little cap for it.\"\\n\\n16. \"True, Kate, but I think the look of perfect delight with which the\\npoor woman regarded her baby in its new dress and cap was something quite\\nworth creating; I do believe she could not have felt more grateful if 1\\nhad sent her a barrel of flour.\"\\n\\n17. \"Well, I never thought before of giving anything to the poor but what\\nthey really needed, and I have always been willing to do that when I could\\nwithout going far out of my way.\"\\n\\n18. \"Ah! cousin, if our heavenly Father gave to us after this mode, we\\nshould have only coarse, shapeless piles of provisions lying about the\\nworld, instead of all this beautiful variety of trees, and fruits, and\\nflowers,\"\\n\\n19. \"Well, well, cousin, I suppose you are right, but have mercy on my\\npoor head; it is too small to hold so many new ideas all at once, so go on\\nyour own way;\" and the little lady began practicing a waltzing step before\\nthe glass with great satisfaction.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

THE CATARACT OF LODORE.\\n\\n1. \"How does the water\\n   Come down at Lodore?\"\\n   My little boy asked me\\n     Thus once on a time;\\n   And, moreover, he tasked me\\n     To tell him in rhyme.\\n\\n2. Anon at the word,\\n   There first came one daughter,\\n   And then came another,\\n     To second and third\\n   The request of their brother,\\n   And to hear how the water\\n     Comes down at Lodore,\\n     With its rush and its roar,\\n       As many a time\\n    They had seen it before.\\n\\n3. So I told them in rhyme,\\n   For of rhymes I had store,\\n     And \\'t was in my vocation\\n     For their recreation\\n   That so I should sing;\\n   Because I was Laureate\\n   To them and the King.\\n\\n4.

And thence at departing,\\n   Awakening and starting,\\n   It runs through the reeds,\\n   And away it proceeds,\\n   Through meadow and glade,\\n   In sun and in shade,\\n   And through the wood shelter,\\n     Among crags in its flurry,\\n   Helter-skelter,\\n     Hurry-skurry.\\n\\n6. Here it comes sparkling,\\n   And there it lies darkling;\\n   Now smoking and frothing\\n   Its tumult and wrath in,\\n   Till, in this rapid race\\n     On which it is bent,\\n   It reaches the place\\n     Of its steep descent.\\n\\n7. The cataract strong\\n   Then plunges along,\\n   Striking and raging\\n   As if a war waging\\nIts caverns and rocks among;\\n\\n8. Rising and leaping,\\n   Sinking and creeping,\\n   Swelling and sweeping,\\n   Showering and springing,\\n   Flying and flinging,\\n   Writhing and ringing,\\n   Eddying and whisking,\\n   Spouting and frisking,\\n   Turning and twisting,\\n   Around and around\\n   With endless rebound;\\n   Smiting and fighting,\\n   A sight to delight in;\\n   Confounding, astounding,\\nDizzying, and deafening the ear with its sound\\n\\n9.

Lodore is a cascade on the banks of Lake Derwentwater, in\\nCumberland, England, near where Southey lived.\\n\\n3. Laureate. The term probably arose from a custom in the English\\nuniversities of presenting a laurel wreath to graduates in rhetoric and\\nversification. In England the poet laureate\\'s office is filled by\\nappointment of the lord chamberlain. The salary is quite small, and the\\noffice is valued chiefly as one of honor.\\n\\nThis lesson is peculiarly adapted for practice on the difficult sound\\n\"ing\".\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIX. THE BOBOLINK.\\n\\n1. The happiest bird of our spring, however, and one that rivals the\\nEuropean lark in my estimation, is the boblincoln, or bobolink as he is\\ncommonly called. He arrives at that choice portion of our year which, in\\nthis latitude, answers to the description of the month of May so often\\ngiven by the poets. With us it begins about the middle of May, and lasts\\nuntil nearly the middle of June. Earlier than this, winter is apt to\\nreturn on its traces, and to blight the opening beauties of the year; and\\nlater than this, begin the parching, and panting, and dissolving heats of\\nsummer. But in this genial interval, Nature is in all her freshness and\\nfragrance: \"the rains are over and gone, the flowers appear upon the\\nearth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the\\nturtle is heard in the land.\"\\n\\n2. The trees are now in their fullest foliage and brightest verdure; the\\nwoods are gay with the clustered flowers of the laurel; the air is\\nperfumed with the sweetbrier and the wild rose; the meadows are enameled\\nwith clover blossoms; while the young apple, peach, and the plum begin to\\nswell, and the cherry to glow among the green leaves.\\n\\n3. This is the chosen season of revelry of the bobolink. He comes amid the\\npomp and fragrance of the season; his life seems all sensibility and\\nenjoyment, all song and sunshine. He is to be found in the soft bosoms of\\nthe freshest and sweetest meadows, and is most in song when the clover is\\nin blossom. He perches on the topmost twig of a tree, or on some long,\\nflaunting weed, and, as he rises and sinks with the breeze, pours forth a\\nsuccession of rich, tinkling notes, crowding one upon another, like the\\noutpouring melody of the skylark, and possessing the same rapturous\\ncharacter.\\n\\n4. Sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree, begins his song as soon\\nas he gets upon the wing, and flutters tremulously down to the earth, as\\nif overcome with ecstasy at his own music. Sometimes he is in pursuit of\\nhis mate; always in full song, as if he would win her by his melody; and\\nalways with the same appearance of intoxication and delight. Of all the\\nbirds of our groves and meadows, the bobolink was the envy of my boyhood.\\nHe crossed my path in the sweetest weather, and the sweetest season of the\\nyear, when all nature called to the fields, and the rural feeling throbbed\\nin every bosom; but when I, luckless urchin! was doomed to be mewed up,\\nduring the live-long day, in a schoolroom.\\n\\n5. It seemed as if the little varlet mocked at me as he flew by in full\\nsong, and sought to taunt me with his happier lot. Oh, how I envied him!\\nNo lessons, no task, no school; nothing but holiday, frolic, green fields,\\nand fine weather. Had I been then more versed in poetry, I might have\\naddressed him in the words of Logan to the cuckoo:\\n\\n    \"Sweet bird, thy bower is ever green,\\n      Thy sky is ever clear;\\n    Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,\\n      No winter in thy year.\\n\\n    \"Oh. could I fly, I\\'d fly with thee!\\n      We\\'d make, with joyful wing,\\n    Our annual visit o\\'er the globe,\\n      Companions of the spring.\"\\n\\n6. Further observation and experience have given me a different idea of\\nthis feathered voluptuary, which I will venture to impart for the benefit\\nof my young readers, who may regard him with the same unqualified envy and\\nadmiration which I once indulged. I have shown him only as I saw him at\\nfirst, in what I may call the poetical part of his career, when he, in a\\nmanner, devoted himself to elegant pursuits and enjoyments, and was a bird\\nof music, and song, and taste, and sensibility, and refinement. While this\\nlasted he was sacred from injury; the very schoolboy would not fling a\\nstone at him, and the merest rustic would pause to listen to his strain.\\n\\n7. But mark the difference. As the year advances, as the clover blossoms\\ndisappear, and the spring fades into summer, he gradually gives up his\\nelegant tastes and habits, doffs his poetical suit of black, assumes a\\nrusset, dusty garb, and sinks to the gross enjoyment of common vulgar\\nbirds. His notes no longer vibrate on the ear; he is stuffing himself with\\nthe seeds of the tall weeds on which he lately swung and chanted so\\nmelodiously. He has become a bon vivant, a gourmand: with him now there is\\nnothing like the \"joys of the table.\" In a little while he grows tired of\\nplain, homely fare, and is off on a gastronomic tour in quest of foreign\\nluxuries.\\n\\n8. We next hear of him, with myriads of his kind, banqueting among the\\nreeds of the Delaware, and grown corpulent with good feeding. He has\\nchanged his name in traveling. Boblincoln no more, he is the reedbird now,\\nthe much-sought-for tidbit of Pennsylvanian epicures, the rival in unlucky\\nfame of the ortolan! Wherever he goes, pop! pop! pop! every rusty firelock\\nin the country is blazing away. He sees his companions falling by\\nthousands around him. Does he take warning and reform? Alas! not he. Again\\nhe wings his flight. The rice swamps of the south invite him. He gorges\\nhimself among them almost to bursting; he can scarcely fly for corpulency.\\nHe has once more changed his name, and is now the famous ricebird of the\\nCarolinas. Last stage of his career: behold him spitted with dozens of his\\ncorpulent companions, and served up, a vaunted dish, on some southern\\ntable.\\n\\n9. Such is the story of the bobolink; once spiritual, musical,\\nadmired, the joy of the meadows, and the favorite bird of spring; finally,\\na gross little sensualist, who expiates his sensuality in the larder. His\\nstory contains a moral worthy the attention of all little birds and little\\nboys; warning them to keep to those refined and intellectual pursuits\\nwhich raised him to so high a pitch of popularity during the early part of\\nhis career, but to eschew all tendency to that gross and dissipated\\nindulgence which brought this mistaken little bird to an untimely end.\\n\\n                                        --From Irving\\'s \"Birds of Spring.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--En-am\\'eled, coated with a smooth, glossy surface. 3.\\nSen-si-bil\\'i-ty, feeling. 4.

REBELLION IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE PRISON.\\n\\n1. A more impressive exhibition of moral courage, opposed to the wildest\\nferocity under the most appalling circumstances, was never seen than that\\nwhich was witnessed by the officers of our state prison; in the rebellion\\nwhich occurred some years since.\\n\\n2. Three convicts had been sentenced, under the rules of the prison, to be\\nwhipped in the yard, and, by some effort of one of the other prisoners, a\\ndoor had been opened at midday communicating with the great dining hall\\nand, through the warden\\'s lodge, with the street.\\n\\n3. The dining hall was long, dark, and damp, from its situation near the\\nsurface of the ground; and in this all the prisoners assembled, with clubs\\nand such other tools as they could seize in passing through the workshops.\\n\\n\\n4. Knives, hammers, and chisels, with every variety of such weapons, were\\nin the hands of the ferocious spirits, who are drawn away from their\\nencroachments on society, forming a congregation of strength, vileness,\\nand talent that can hardly be equaled on earth, even among the famed\\nbrigands of Italy.\\n\\n5. Men of all ages and characters, guilty of every variety of infamous\\ncrime, dressed in the motley and peculiar garb of the institution, and\\ndisplaying the wild and demoniac appearance that always pertains to\\nimprisoned wretches, were gathered together for the single purpose of\\npreventing the punishment which was to be inflicted on the morrow upon\\ntheir comrades.\\n\\n6. The warden, the surgeon, and some other officers of the prison were\\nthere at the time, and were alarmed at the consequences likely to ensue\\nfrom the conflict necessary to restore order. They huddled together, and\\ncould scarcely be said to consult, as the stoutest among them lost all\\npresence of mind in overwhelming fear. The news rapidly spread through the\\ntown, and a subordinate officer, of the most mild and kind disposition,\\nhurried to the scene, and came calm and collected into the midst of the\\nofficers. The most equable-tempered and the mildest man in the government\\nwas in this hour of peril the firmest.\\n\\n7. He instantly dispatched a request to Major Wainright, commander of the\\nmarines stationed at the Navy Yard, for assistance, and declared his\\npurpose to enter into the hall and try the force of firm demeanor and\\npersuasion upon the enraged multitude.\\n\\n8. All his brethren exclaimed against an attempt so full of hazard, but in\\nvain. They offered him arms, a sword and pistols, but he refused them, and\\nsaid that he had no fear, and, in case of danger, arms would do him no\\nservice; and alone, with only a little rattan, which was his usual walking\\nstick, he advanced into the hall to hold parley with the selected,\\ncongregated, and enraged villains of the whole commonwealth.\\n\\n9. He demanded their purpose in thus coming together with arms, in\\nviolation of the prison laws. They replied that they were determined to\\nobtain the remission of the punishment of their three comrades. He said it\\nwas impossible; the rules of the prison must be obeyed, and they must\\nsubmit.\\n\\n10. At the hint of submission they drew a little nearer together, prepared\\ntheir weapons for service, and, as they were dimly seen in the further end\\nof the hall by those who observed from the gratings that opened up to the\\nday, a more appalling sight can not be conceived, nor one of more moral\\ngrandeur, than that of the single man standing within their grasp, and\\nexposed to be torn limb from limb instantly if a word or look should add\\nto the already intense excitement.\\n\\n11. That excitement, too, was of a most dangerous kind. It broke not forth\\nin noise and imprecations, but was seen only in the dark looks and the\\nstrained nerves that showed a deep determination. The officer\\nexpostulated. He reminded them of the hopelessness of escape; that the\\ntown was alarmed, and that the government of the prison would submit to\\nnothing but unconditional surrender. He said that all those who would go\\nquietly away should be forgiven for this offense; but that if every\\nprisoner were killed in the contest, power enough would be obtained to\\nenforce the regulations of the prison.\\n\\n12. They replied that they expected that some would be killed,--that\\ndeath would be better than such imprisonment; and, with that look and tone\\nwhich bespeak an indomitable purpose, they declared that not a man should\\nleave the hall alive till the flogging was remitted. At this period of the\\ndiscussion their evil passions seemed to be more inflamed, and one or two\\noffered to destroy the officer, who still stood firmer and with a more\\ntemperate pulse than did his friends, who saw from above, but could not\\navert, the danger that threatened him.\\n\\n13. Just at this moment, and in about fifteen minutes from the\\ncommencement of the tumult, the officer saw the feet of the marines, on\\nwhose presence alone he relied for succor, filing by the small upper\\nlights. Without any apparent anxiety, he had repeatedly turned his\\nattention to their approach; and now he knew that it was his only time to\\nescape, before the conflict became, as was expected, one of the most dark\\nand dreadful in the world.\\n\\n14. He stepped slowly backward, still urging them to depart before the\\nofficers were driven to use the last resort of firearms. When within three\\nor four feet of the door, it was opened, and closed instantly again as he\\nsprang through, and was thus unexpectedly restored to his friends.\\n\\n15. Major Wainright was requested to order his men to fire down upon the\\nconvicts through the little windows, first with powder and then with ball,\\ntill they were willing to retreat; but he took a wiser as well as a bolder\\ncourse, relying upon the effect which firm determination would have upon\\nmen so critically situated. He ordered the door to be again opened, and\\nmarched in at the head of twenty or thirty men, who filed through the\\npassage, and formed at the end of the hall opposite to the crowd of\\ncriminals huddled together at the other.\\n\\n16. He stated that he was empowered to quell the rebellion, that he wished\\nto avoid shedding blood, but that he would not quit that hall alive till\\nevery convict had returned to his duty. They seemed balancing the strength\\nof the two parties, and replied that some of them were ready to die, and\\nonly waited for an attack to see which was the more powerful; swearing\\nthat they would fight to the last, unless the punishment was remitted, for\\nthey would not submit to any such punishment in the prison. Major\\nWainright ordered his marines to load their pieces, and, that they might\\nnot be suspected of trifling, each man was made to hold up to view the\\nbullet which he afterward put in his gun.\\n\\n17. This only caused a growl of determination, and no one blenched or\\nseemed disposed to shrink from the foremost exposure. They knew that their\\nnumber would enable them to bear down and destroy the handful of marines\\nafter the first discharge, and before their pieces could be reloaded.\\nAgain they were ordered to retire; but they answered with more ferocity\\nthan ever. The marines were ordered to take their aim so as to be sure and\\nkill as many as possible. Their guns were presented, but not a prisoner\\nstirred, except to grasp more firmly his weapon.\\n\\n18. Still desirous to avoid such a tremendous slaughter as must have\\nfollowed the discharge of a single gun, Major Wainright advanced a step or\\ntwo, and spoke even more firmly than before, urging them to depart. Again,\\nand while looking directly into the muzzles of the guns which they had\\nseen loaded with ball, they declared their intention \"to fight it out.\"\\nThis intrepid officer then took out his watch, and told his men to hold\\ntheir pieces aimed at the convicts, but not to fire till they had orders;\\nthen, turning to the prisoners, he said: \"You must leave this hall; I give\\nyou three minutes to decide; if at the end of that time a man remains, he\\nshall be shot dead.\"\\n\\n19. No situation of greater interest than this can be conceived. At one\\nend of the hall, a fearful multitude of the most desperate and powerful\\nmen in existence, waiting for the assault; at the other, a little band of\\ndisciplined men, waiting with arms presented, and ready, upon the least\\nmotion or sign, to begin the carnage; and their tall and imposing\\ncommander, holding up his watch to count the lapse of three minutes, given\\nas the reprieve to the lives of hundreds. No poet or painter can conceive\\na spectacle of more dark and terrible sublimity; no human heart can\\nconceive a situation of more appalling suspense.\\n\\n20. For two minutes not a person nor a muscle moved; not a sound was heard\\nin the unwonted stillness of the prison, except the labored breathings of\\nthe infuriated wretches, as they began to pant between fear and revenge:\\nat the expiration of two minutes, during which they had faced the\\nministers of death with unblenching eyes, two or three of those in the\\nrear, and nearest the further entrance, went slowly out; a few more\\nfollowed the example, dropping out quietly and deliberately: and before\\nhalf of the last minute was gone, every man was struck by the panic, and\\ncrowded for an exit, and the hall was cleared, as if by magic.\\n\\n21. Thus the steady firmness of moral force and the strong effect of\\ndetermination, acting deliberately, awed the most savage men, and\\nsuppressed a scene of carnage, which would have instantly followed the\\nleast precipitancy or exertion of physical force.\\n                                                     --J.

FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY.\\n\\nThomas Hood (b. 1798, d. 1845) was the son of a London bookseller. After\\nleaving school he undertook to learn the art of an engraver, but soon\\nturned his attention to literature. In 1821 he became sub-editor of the\\n\"London Magazine.\" Hood is best known as a humorist; but some of his poems\\nare full of the tenderest pathos; and a gentle, humane spirit pervades\\neven his lighter productions. He was poor, and during the last years of\\nhis life suffered much from ill health. Some of his most humorous pieces\\nwere written on a sick bed.\\n\\n1. Ben Battle was a soldier bold,\\n     And used to war\\'s alarms;\\n   But a cannon ball took off his legs,\\n     So he laid down his arms!\\n\\n2. Now, as they bore him off the field,\\n     Said he, \"Let others shoot,\\n   For here I leave my second leg,\\n     And the Forty-second Foot!\"\\n\\n3. The army surgeons made him limbs;\\n     Said he, \"They\\'re only pegs:\\n   But there\\'s as wooden members quite,\\n     As represent my legs!\"\\n\\n4. Now Ben, he loved a pretty maid,\\n     Her Name was Nelly Gray;\\n   So he went to pay her his devoirs,\\n     When he\\'d devoured his pay.\\n\\n5. But when he called on Nelly Gray,\\n     She made him quite a scoff;\\n   And when she saw his wooden legs,\\n     Began to take them off!\\n\\n6. \"O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!\\n     Is this your love so warm\\'?\\n   The love that loves a scarlet coat\\n     Should be more uniform!\"\\n\\n7. Said she, \"I loved a soldier once,\\n     For he was blithe and brave;\\n   But I will never have a man\\n     With both legs in the grave!\\n\\n8. \"Before you had these timber toes,\\n     Your love I did allow,\\n   But then, you know, you stand upon\\n     Another footing now!\"\\n\\n9. \"O false and fickle Nelly Gray!\\n     I know why you refuse:\\n   Though I\\'ve no feet--some other man\\n     Is standing in my shoes!\\n\\n10. \"I wish I ne\\'er had seen your face;\\n      But, now, a long farewell!\\n    For you will be my death;--alas!\\n      You will not be my NELL!\"\\n\\n11. Now when he went from Nelly Gray,\\n      His heart so heavy got,\\n    And life was such a burden grown,\\n      It made him take a knot!\\n\\n12. So round his melancholy neck,\\n      A rope he did entwine,\\n    And for the second time in life.\\n      Enlisted in the Line!\\n\\n13. One end he tied around a beam,\\n      And then removed his pegs,\\n    And, as his legs were off, of course\\n      He soon was off his legs.\\n\\n14. And there he hung till he was dead\\n      As any nail in town:\\n    For, though distress had cut him up,\\n      It could not cut him down!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--4.

THE GENEROUS RUSSIAN PEASANT.\\n\\n1. Let Vergil sing the praises of Augustus, genius celebrate merit, and\\nflattery extol the talents of the great. \"The short and simple annals of\\nthe poor\" engross my pen; and while I record the history of Flor Silin\\'s\\nvirtues, though I speak of a poor peasant, I shall describe a noble man. I\\nask no eloquence to assist me in the task; modest worth rejects the aid of\\nornament to set it off.\\n\\n2. It is impossible, even at this distant period, to reflect without\\nhorror on the miseries of that year known in Lower Volga by the name of\\nthe \"Famine Year.\" I remember the summer, whose scorching heats had dried\\nup all the fields, and the drought had no relief but from the tears of the\\nruined farmer.\\n\\n3. I remember the cold, comfortless autumn, and the despairing rustics,\\ncrowding round their empty barns, with folded arms and sorrowful\\ncountenances, pondering on their misery, instead of rejoicing, as usual,\\nat the golden harvest. I remember the winter which succeeded, and I\\nreflect with agony on the miseries it brought with it. Whole families left\\ntheir homes to become beggars on the highway.\\n\\n4. At night the canopy of heaven served them as their only shelter from\\nthe piercing winds and bitter frost. To describe these scenes would be to\\nharm the feelings of my readers; therefore, to my tale. In those days I\\nlived on an estate not far from Simbirsk; and, though but a child, I have\\nnot forgotten the impression made on my mind by the general calamity.\\n\\n5. In a village adjoining lived Flor Silin, a poor, laboring peasant,--a\\nman remarkable for his assiduity and the skill and judgment with which he\\ncultivated his lands. He was blessed with abundant crops; and his means\\nbeing larger than his wants, his granaries, even at this time, were full\\nof corn. The dry year coming on had beggared all the village except\\nhimself. Here was an opportunity to grow rich. Mark how Flor Silin acted.\\nHaving called the poorest of his neighbors about him, he addressed them in\\nthe following manner:\\n\\n6. \"My friends, you want corn for your subsistence. God has blessed me\\nwith abundance. Assist in thrashing out a quantity, and each of you take\\nwhat he wants for his family.\" The peasants were amazed at this unexampled\\ngenerosity; for sordid propensities exist in the village as well as in the\\npopulous city.\\n\\n7. The fame of Flor Silin\\'s benevolence having reached other villages, the\\nfamished inhabitants presented themselves before him, and begged for corn.\\nThis good creature received them as brothers; and, while his store\\nremained, afforded all relief. At length, his wife, seeing no end to the\\ngenerosity of his noble spirit, reminded him how necessary it would be to\\nthink of their own wants, and hold his lavish hand before it was too late.\\n\"It is written in the Scripture,\" said he, \"Give, and it shall be given\\nunto you.\\'\"\\n\\n8. The following year Providence listened to the prayers of the poor, and\\nthe harvest was abundant. The peasants who had been saved from starving by\\nFlor Silin now gathered around him.\\n\\n9. \"Behold,\" said they, \"the corn you lent us. You saved our wives and\\nchildren. We should have been famished but for you; may God reward you; he\\nonly can; all we have to give is our corn and grateful thanks.\" \"I want no\\ncorn at present, my good neighbors,\" said he; \"my harvest has exceeded all\\nmy expectations; for the rest, thank heaven: I have been but an humble\\ninstrument.\"\\n\\n10. They urged him in vain. \"No,\" said he, \"I shall not accept your corn.\\nIf you have superfluities, share them among your poor neighbors, who,\\nbeing unable to sow their fields last autumn, are still in want; let us\\nassist them, my dear friends; the Almighty will bless us for it.\" \"Yes,\"\\nreplied the grateful peasants, \"our poor neighbors shall have this corn.\\nThey shall know it is to you that they owe this timely succor, and join to\\nteach their children the debt of gratitude due to your benevolent heart.\"\\nSilin raised his tearful eyes to heaven. An angel might have envied him\\nhis feelings.\\n                                                       --Nikolai Karamzin.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ex-tol\\', to elevate by praise.

FORTY YEARS AGO.\\n\\n1. I\\'ve wandered to the village, Tom,\\n      I\\'ve sat beneath the tree,\\n   Upon the schoolhouse playground,\\n     That sheltered you and me;\\n   But none were left to greet me, Tom,\\n     And few were left to know,\\n   Who played with me upon the green,\\n     Just forty years ago.\\n\\n2. The grass was just as green, Tom,\\n     Barefooted boys at play\\n   Were sporting, just as we did then,\\n     With spirits just as gay.\\n   But the master sleeps upon the hill,\\n     Which, coated o\\'er with snow,\\n   Afforded us a sliding place,\\n     Some forty years ago.\\n\\n3. The old schoolhouse is altered some;\\n     The benches are replaced\\n   By new ones very like the same\\n     Our jackknives had defaced.\\n   But the same old bricks are in the wall,\\n     The bell swings to and fro;\\n   Its music\\'s just the same, dear Tom,\\n     \\'T was forty years ago.\\n\\n4. The spring that bubbled \\'neath the hill,\\n     Close by the spreading beech,\\n   Is very low; \\'t was once so high\\n     That we could almost reach;\\n   And kneeling down to take a drink,\\n     Dear Tom, I started so,\\n   To think how very much I\\'ve changed\\n     Since forty years ago.\\n\\n5. Near by that spring, upon an elm,\\n     You know, I cut your name,\\n   Your sweetheart\\'s just beneath it, Tom;\\n     And you did mine the same.\\n   Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark;\\n     \\'T was dying sure, but slow,\\n   Just as that one whose name you cut\\n     Died forty years ago.\\n\\n6. My lids have long been dry, Tom,\\n     But tears came in my eyes:\\n   I thought of her I loved so well,\\n     Those early broken ties.\\n   I visited the old churchyard,\\n     And took some flowers to strew\\n   Upon the graves of those we loved\\n     Just forty years ago.\\n\\n7. Some are in the churchyard laid,\\n     Some sleep beneath the sea;\\n   And none are left of our old class\\n     Excepting you and me.\\n   And when our time shall come, Tom,\\n     And we are called to go,\\n   I hope we\\'ll meet with those we loved\\n     Some forty years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLV. MRS. CAUDLE\\'S LECTURE.\\n\\nDouglas Jerrold (b. 1803, d. 1857) was born in London. A midshipman\\'s\\nappointment was obtained for him, but he quit the naval service in a few\\nyears. He was then apprenticed to a printer. By improving his leisure\\nhours he made himself master of several languages, and formed the habit of\\nexpressing his thoughts in writing An essay on the opera of Der Freischutz\\nwas his first published literary production. Before he was twenty-one\\nyears of age, he wrote \"Black-eyed Susan,\" one of the most popular dramas\\nof modern times. Several other popular plays followed this. He was a\\nregular contributor to the London \"Punch,\" from the second number, and\\nedited, at different times, several papers and magazines. As a humorist,\\nhe occupies the first rank. The most noted of his works are his plays, and\\n\"Mrs Caudle\\'s Curtain Lectures,\" \"Saint Giles and Saint James,\" \"Bubbles\\nof a Day,\" and \"Chronicles of Clovernook.\"\\n\\n1. Well, Mr. Caudle, I hope you\\'re in a little better temper than you were\\nthis morning. There, you need n\\'t begin to whistle: people don\\'t come to\\nbed to whistle. But it\\'s like you; I can\\'t speak that you don\\'t try to\\ninsult me. Once, I used to say you were the best creature living: now, you\\nget quite a fiend. Do let you rest? No, I won\\'t let you rest. It\\'s the\\nonly time I have to talk to you, and you shall hear me. I\\'m put upon all\\nday long: it\\'s very hard if I can\\'t speak a word at night; besides, it is\\nn\\'t often I open my mouth, goodness knows!\\n\\n2. Because once in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button, you must\\nalmost swear the roof off the house. You did n\\'t swear? Ha, Mr. Caudle!\\nyou don\\'t know what you do when you\\'re in a passion. You were not in a\\npassion, wer\\'n\\'t you? Well, then, I don\\'t know what a passion is; and I\\nthink I ought by this time. I\\'ve lived long enough with you, Mr. Caudle,\\nto know that.\\n\\n3. It\\'s a pity you hav\\'n\\'t something worse to complain of than a button\\noff your shirt. If you\\'d some wives, you would, I know. I\\'m sure I\\'m never\\nwithout a needle and thread in my hand; what with you and the children,\\nI\\'m made a perfect slave of. And what\\'s my thanks? Why, if once in your\\nlife a button\\'s off your shirt--what do you cry \"oh\" at? I say once, Mr.\\nCaudle; or twice, or three times, at most. I\\'m sure, Caudle, no man\\'s\\nbuttons in the world are better looked after than yours. I only wish I\\'d\\nkept the shirts you had when you were first married! I should like to know\\nwhere were your buttons then?\\n\\n4. Yes, it is worth talking of! But that\\'s how you always try to put me\\ndown. You fly into a rage, and then if I only try to speak, you won\\'t hear\\nme. That\\'s how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves: a poor\\nwoman is n\\'t allowed to get a word in. A nice notion you have of a wife,\\nto suppose she\\'s nothing to think of but her husband\\'s buttons. A pretty\\nnotion, indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor women only knew what\\nthey had to go through!--what with buttons, and one thing and\\nanother,--they\\'d never tie themselves up,--no, not to the best man in the\\nworld, I\\'m sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle?--Why, do much better\\nwithout you, I\\'m certain.\\n\\n5. And it\\'s my belief, after all, that the button was n\\'t off the shirt;\\nit\\'s my belief that you pulled it off that you might have something to\\ntalk about. Oh, you\\'re aggravating enough, when you like, for anything!\\nAll I know is, it\\'s very odd that the button should be off the shirt; for\\nI\\'m sure no woman\\'s a greater slave to her husband\\'s buttons than I am. I\\nonly say it\\'s very odd.\\n\\n6. However, there\\'s one comfort; it can\\'t last long. I\\'m worn to death\\nwith your temper, and sha\\'n\\'t trouble you a great while. Ha! you may\\nlaugh! And I dare say you would laugh! I\\'ve no doubt of it! That\\'s your\\nlove; that\\'s your feeling! I know that I\\'m sinking every day, though I say\\nnothing about it. And when I\\'m gone we shall see how your second wife will\\nlook after your buttons! You\\'ll find out the difference then. Yes, Caudle,\\nyou\\'ll think of me then; for then, I hope, you\\'ll never have a blessed\\nbutton to your back.\\n\\n7. No, I\\'m not a vindictive woman, Mr. Caudle: nobody ever called me that\\nbut you. What do you say? Nobody ever knew so much of me? That\\'s nothing\\nat all to do with it. Ha! I would n\\'t have your aggravating temper,\\nCaudle, for mines of gold. It\\'s a good thing I\\'m not as worrying as you\\nare, or a nice house there\\'d be between us. I only wish you\\'d had a wife\\nthat would have talked to you! Then you\\'d have known the difference. But\\nyou impose upon me because, like a poor fool, I say nothing. I should be\\nashamed of myself, Caudle.\\n\\n8. And a pretty example you set as a father! You\\'ll make your boys as bad\\nas yourself. Talking as you did all breakfast time about your buttons! and\\nof a Sunday morning, too! And you call yourself a Christian! I should like\\nto know what your boys will say of you when they grow up! And all about a\\npaltry button off one of your wristbands! A decent man would n\\'t have\\nmentioned it. Why don\\'t I hold my tongue? Because I won\\'t hold my tongue.\\nI\\'m to have my peace of mind destroyed--I \\'m to be worried into my grave\\nfor a miserable shirt button, and I\\'m to hold my tongue! Oh!  but that\\'s\\njust like you men!\\n\\n9. But I know what I\\'ll do for the future. Every button you have may drop\\noff, and I won\\'t so much as put a thread to \\'em. And I should like to know\\nwhat you\\'ll do then! Oh, you must get somebody else to sew \\'em, must you?\\nThat\\'s a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to his wife! And to such\\na wife as I\\'ve been, too: such a slave to your buttons, as I may say.\\nSomebody else to sew \\'em\\'! No, Caudle, no; not while I\\'m alive! When I\\'m\\ndead--and, with what I have to bear, there\\'s no knowing how soon that may\\nbe--when I \\'m dead, I say--oh! what a brute you must be to snore so!\\n\\n10. You\\'re not snoring? Ha! that\\'s what you always say; but that\\'s nothing\\nto do with it. You must get somebody else to sew \\'em, must you? Ha! I\\nshould n\\'t wonder. Oh, no! I should be surprised at nothing now! Nothing\\nat all! It\\'s what people have always told me it would come to; and now the\\nbuttons have opened my eyes! But the whole world shall know of your\\ncruelty, Mr. Caudle. After the wife I\\'ve been to you. Caudle, you\\'ve a\\nheart like a hearthstone, you have!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--5. Ag\\'gra-vat-ing, provoking, irritating. 6. Sink\\'ing,\\nfailing in strength. 7. Vin-dic\\'tive, revengeful. 8. Pal\\'try, mean,\\ncontemptible.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVI. THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.\\n\\n1. Under a spreading chestnut tree\\n     The village smithy stands;\\n   The smith, a mighty man is he,\\n     With large and sinewy hands;\\n   And the muscles of his brawny arms\\n     Are strong as iron bands.\\n\\n2. His hair is crisp, and black, and long,\\n     His face is like the tan;\\n   His brow is wet with honest sweat,\\n     He earns whate\\'er he can,\\n   And looks the whole world in the face,\\n     For he owes not any man.\\n\\n3. Week in, week out, from morn till night,\\n     You can hear his bellows blow;\\n   You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,\\n     With measured beat and slow,\\n   Like a sexton ringing the village bell,\\n     When the evening sun is low.\\n\\n4. And children coming home from school\\n     Look in at the open door;\\n   They love to see the flaming forge,\\n     And hear the bellows roar,\\n   And catch the burning sparks that fly\\n     Like chaff from a threshing floor.\\n\\n5. He goes on Sunday to the church,\\n     And sits among his boys;\\n   He hears the parson pray and preach,\\n     He hears his daughter\\'s voice\\n   Singing in the village choir,\\n     And it makes his heart rejoice.\\n\\n6. It sounds to him like her mother\\'s voice\\n     Singing in Paradise!\\n   He needs must think of her once more,\\n     How in the grave she lies;\\n   And with his hard, rough hand he wipes\\n     A tear out of his eyes.\\n\\n7. Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,\\n     Onward through life he goes;\\n   Each morning sees some task begin,\\n     Each evening sees its close;\\n   Something attempted, something done,\\n     Has earned a night\\'s repose.\\n\\n8. Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,\\n     For the lesson thou hast taught!\\n   Thus at the flaming forge of life\\n     Our fortunes must be wrought;\\n   Thus on its sounding anvil shaped\\n     Each burning deed and thought!\\n                                      --Longfellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVII. THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.\\n\\n[From a letter to the \"London Times,\" by a lady, the wife of an officer at\\nLucknow.]\\n\\n1. On every side death stared us in the face; no human skill could avert\\nit any longer. We saw the moment approach when we must bid farewell to\\nearth, yet without feeling that unutterable horror which must have been\\nexperienced by the unhappy victims at Cawnpore. We were resolved rather to\\ndie than to yield, and were fully persuaded that in twenty-four hours all\\nwould be over. The engineer had said so, and all knew the worst. We women\\nstrove to encourage each other, and to perform the light duties which had\\nbeen assigned to us, such as conveying orders to the batteries, and\\nsupplying the men with provisions, especially cups of coffee, which we\\nprepared day and night.\\n\\n2. I had gone out to try to make myself useful, in company with Jessie\\nBrown, the wife of a corporal in my husband\\'s regiment. Poor Jessie had\\nbeen in a state of restless excitement all through the siege, and had\\nfallen away visibly within the last few days. A constant fever consumed\\nher, and her mind wandered occasionally, especially that day, when the\\nrecollections of home seemed powerfully present to her. At last, overcome\\nwith fatigue, she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in her plaid. I sat\\nbeside her, promising to awaken her when, as she said, her \"father should\\nreturn from the plowing.\"\\n\\n3. She fell at length into a profound slumber, motionless and apparently\\nbreathless, her head resting in my lap. I myself could no longer resist\\nthe inclination to sleep, in spite of the continual roar of the cannon.\\nSuddenly I was aroused by a wild, unearthly scream close to my ear; my\\ncompanion stood upright beside me, her arms raised, and her head bent\\nforward in the attitude of listening.\\n\\n4. A look of intense delight broke over her countenance; she grasped my\\nhand, drew me toward her, and exclaimed: \"Dinna ye hear it? dinna ye hear\\nit? Ay. I\\'m no dreaming: it\\'s the slogan o\\' the Highlanders! We\\'re saved!\\nwe\\'re saved!\" Then flinging herself on her knees, she thanked God with\\npassionate fervor. I felt utterly bewildered; my English ears heard only\\nthe roar of artillery, and I thought my poor Jessie was still raving; but\\nshe darted to the batteries, and I heard her cry incessantly to the men,\\n\"Courage! courage! Hark to the slogan--to the Macgregor, the grandest of\\nthem a\\'! Here\\'s help at last!\"\\n\\n5. To describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers would be\\nimpossible. For a moment they ceased firing, and every soul listened with\\nintense anxiety. Gradually, however, there arose a murmur of bitter\\ndisappointment, and the wailing of the women, who had flocked to the spot,\\nburst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our dull Lowland ears heard\\nonly the battle of the musketry. A few moments more of this deathlike\\nsuspense, of this agonizing hope, and Jessie, who had again sunk on the\\nground, sprang to her feet, and cried in a voice so clear and piercing\\nthat it was heard along the whole line, \"Will ye no believe it noo? The\\nslogan has ceased, indeed, but the Campbells are comin\\'! D\\' ye hear? d\\' ye\\nhear?\"\\n\\n6. At that moment all seemed indeed to hear the voice of God in the\\ndistance, when the pibroch of the Highlanders brought us tidings of\\ndeliverance; for now there was no longer any doubt of the fact. That\\nshrill, penetrating, ceaseless sound, which rose above all other sounds,\\ncould come neither from the advance of the enemy nor from the work of the\\nsappers. No, it was indeed the blast of the Scottish bagpipes, now shrill\\nand harsh, as threatening vengeance on the foe, then in softer tones,\\nseeming to promise succor to their friends in need.\\n\\n7. Never, surely, was there such a scene as that which followed. Not a\\nheart in the residency of Lucknow but bowed itself before God. All, by one\\nsimultaneous impulse, fell upon their knees, and nothing was heard but\\nbursting sobs and the murmured voice of prayer. Then all arose, and there\\nrang out from a thousand lips a great shout of joy, which resounded far\\nand wide, and lent new vigor to that blessed pibroch.\\n\\n8. To our cheer of \"God save the Queen,\" they replied by the well-known\\nstrain that moves every Scot to tears, \"Should auld acquaintance be\\nforgot.\" After that, nothing else made any impression on me. I scarcely\\nremember what followed. Jessie was presented to the general on his\\nentrance into the fort, and at the officers\\' banquet her health was drunk\\nby all present, while the pipers marched around the table playing once\\nmore the familiar air of \"Auld Lang Syne.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. A-vert\\', to turn aside. En-gi-neer\\', an officer in the\\narmy, who designs and constructs defensive and offensive works. 2. Siege,\\nthe setting of an army around a fortified place to compel its surrender.\\n3. Pro-found\\', deep. 4. Slo\\'gan, the war cry or gather-ing word of a\\nHighland clan in Scotland.

Sap\\'pers, men employed in making an approach\\nto a fortified place by digging. 7. Res\\'i-den-cy, the official dwelling of\\na government officer in India. Si-mul-ta\\'ne-ous, happening at the same\\ntime.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Lucknow, a city in the British possession of India. In 1857 there\\nwas a mutiny of the native troops, and the British garrison of 1700 men\\nwas besieged by 10,000 mutineers. After twelve weeks\\' siege, fresh British\\ntroops forced an entrance, and the town was held until relieved three\\nweeks later by the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell, as above described.\\n\\n1. Cawnpore, also a city of India, near Lucknow, which was besieged during\\nthe mutiny. After surrendering, the English, two thirds of whom were women\\nand children, were treacherously massacred.\\n\\n4. The inhabitants of the northern part of Scotland are called\\nHighlanders; those of the southern part, Lowlanders. The dialect of the\\nformer is very peculiar, as shown in the language of Jessie Brown; as,\\ndinna for did not, a\\' for all, no for not, noo for now, auld for old.\\nMacgregor and Campbell are names of Highland clans or families.\\n\\nWhittier\\'s poem, \"The Pipes at Lucknow,\" and Robert T. S. Lowell\\'s \"The\\nRelief of Lucknow,\" are descriptive of this same incident.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVIII. THE SNOWSTORM.\\n\\nJames Thomson (b. 1700, d.1748) was born at Ednam, in the shire of\\nRoxburgh, Scotland. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and\\nafterwards studied for the ministry, but in a short time changed his plans\\nand devoted himself to literature. His early poems are quite\\ninsignificant, but \"The Seasons,\" from which the following selection is\\ntaken; and the \"Castle of Indolence,\" are masterpieces of English poetry.\\n\\n1. Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends,\\n   At first thin wavering; till at last the flakes\\n   Fall broad and wide and fast, dimming the day,\\n   With a continual flow. The cherished fields\\n   Put on their winter robe of purest white.\\n   \\'T is brightness all: save where the new snow melts\\n   Along the mazy current.\\n\\n2.                           Low the woods\\n   Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid sun\\n   Faint from the west emits its evening ray,\\n   Earth\\'s universal face, deep-hid and chill,\\n   Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide\\n   The works of man.\\n\\n3.                           Drooping, the laborer ox\\n   Stands covered o\\'er with snow, and then demands\\n   The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,\\n   Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around\\n   The winnowing store, and claim the little boon\\n   Which Providence assigns them.\\n\\n4.                           One alone,\\n   The Redbreast, sacred to the household gods,\\n   Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,\\n   In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves\\n   His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man\\n   His annual visit.\\n\\n5.                           Half-afraid, he first\\n   Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights\\n   On the warm hearth; then, hopping o\\'er the floor,\\n   Eyes all the smiling family askance,\\n   And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is;\\n   Till, more familiar grown, the table crumbs\\n   Attract his slender feet.\\n\\n6.                           The foodless wilds\\n   Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare,\\n   Though timorous of heart, and hard beset\\n   By death in various forms, dark snares and dogs,\\n   And more unpitying men, the garden seeks,\\n   Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind.\\n   Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth,\\n   With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispersed,\\n   Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow\\n\\n7. Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind,\\n   Baffle the raging year, and fill their pens\\n   With food at will; lodge them below the storm,\\n   And watch them strict; for from the bellowing east,\\n   In this dire season, oft the whirlwind\\'s wing\\n   Sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains\\n   In one wide waft, and o\\'er the hapless flocks,\\n   Hid in the hollow of two neighboring hills,\\n   The billowy tempest \\'whelms; till, upward urged,\\n   The valley to a shining mountain swells,\\n   Tipped with a wreath high-curling in the sky\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ma\\'zy, winding. 2. Hoar, white or grayish white. E-mits\\',\\nsends forth, throws out, 3. Win\\'now-ing, separat-ing chaff from grain by\\nmeans of wind. Boon, a gift. 4. Em--broil\\'ing, throwing into disorder or\\ncontention. 5, A-skance\\', side-ways. 6. Wilds, woods, forests. Be-set\\',\\nhemmed in on all sides so that escape is difficult. 7. Dire, dreadful,\\nterrible. Waft, a current of wind. Whelms\\', covers completely.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--4. Household gods. An allusion to the belief of the ancient Romans\\nin the Penates--certain gods who were supposed to protect the household\\nand all connected with it. The idea here expressed is, that the Redbreast\\nwas secure from harm.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLIX. BEHIND TIME.\\n\\n1. A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning speed. A curve\\nwas just ahead, beyond which was a station where two trains usually met.\\nThe conductor was late,--so late that the period during which the up train\\nwas to wait had nearly elapsed; but he hoped yet to pass the curve safely.\\nSuddenly a locomotive dashed into sight right ahead. In an instant there\\nwas a collision. A shriek, a shock, and fifty souls were in eternity; and\\nall because an engineer had been behind time.\\n\\n2. A great battle was going on. Column after column had been precipitated\\nfor eight hours on the enemy posted along the ridge of a hill. The summer\\nsun was sinking in the west; reenforcements for the obstinate defenders\\nwere already in sight; it was necessary to carry the position with one\\nfinal charge, or everything would be lost.\\n\\n3. A powerful corps had been summoned from across the country, and if it\\ncame up in season all would yet be well. The great conqueror, confident in\\nits arrival, formed his reserve into an attacking column, and ordered them\\nto charge the enemy. The whole world knows the result. Grouchy failed to\\nappear; the imperial guard was beaten back; and Waterloo was lost.\\nNapoleon died a prisoner at St. Helena because one of his marshals was\\nbehind time.\\n\\n4. A leading firm in commercial circles had long struggled against\\nbankruptcy. As it had large sums of money in California, it expected\\nremittances by a certain day, and if they arrived, its credit, its honor,\\nand its future prosperity would be preserved. But week after week elapsed\\nwithout bringing the gold. At last came the fatal day on which the firm\\nhad bills maturing to large amounts. The steamer was telegraphed at\\ndaybreak; but it was found, on inquiry, that she brought no funds, and the\\nhouse failed. The next arrival brought nearly half a million to the\\ninsolvents, but it was too late; they were ruined because their agent, in\\nremitting, had been behind time.\\n\\n5. A condemned man was led, out for execution. He had taken human life,\\nbut under circumstances of the greatest provocation, and public sympathy\\nwas active in his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions for a reprieve; a\\nfavorable answer had been expected the night before, and though it had not\\ncome, even the sheriff felt confident that it would yet arrive. Thus the\\nmorning passed without the appearance of the messenger.\\n\\n6. The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place, the cap was drawn\\nover his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a lifeless body swung revolving in\\nthe wind. Just at that moment a horseman came into sight, galloping down\\nhill, his steed covered with foam. He carried a packet in his right hand,\\nwhich he waved frantically to the crowd. He was the express rider with the\\nreprieve; but he came too late. A comparatively innocent man had died an\\nignominious death because a watch had been five minutes too late, making\\nits bearer arrive behind time.\\n\\n7. It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most important\\naffairs, the fortunes of individuals, the weal of nations, honor,\\nhappiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed, because somebody is \"behind\\ntime.\" There are men who always fail in whatever they undertake, simply\\nbecause they are \"behind time.\" There are others who put off reformation\\nyear after year, till death seizes them, and they perish unrepentant,\\nbecause forever \"behind time.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Col-li\\'sion, the act of striking together violently. 2.\\nPre-cip\\'i-tat-ed, urged on violently. Re-en-force\\'ments, additional\\ntroops. 3. Corps (pro. kor), a body of troops. Re-serve\\', a select body of\\ntroops held back in case of special need for their services. 4.\\nBank\\'rupt-cy. inability to pay all debts, insolvency. Re-mit\\'tanc-es,\\nmouey, drafts, etc., sent from a distance. Ma-tur\\'ing, approaching the\\ntime fixed for payment. 5. Prov-o-ca\\'tion, that which causes anger. 6.\\nIg-no-min\\'i-ous, infamous. 7. Weal, prosperity, happiness.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--3. Emmanuel Grouchy was one of Napoleon\\'s marshals at the battle\\nof Waterloo, fought in 1815 between the French under Napoleon, and the\\nEnglish, Dutch, and German troops under Wellington.\\n\\nNapoleon Bonaparte (b. 1769, d. 1821) was born on the island of Corsica.\\nAt school he was \"studious, well-behaved, and distinguished in\\nmathematical studies.\" In 1785 he was commissioned as a sublieutenant in\\nthe army. From this obscure position he raised himself to the head of the\\narmy, and in 1804 was elected emperor of the French. He is almost\\nuniversally acknowledged to have been the greatest general the world has\\nknown.\\n\\n\\n\\nL. THE OLD SAMPLER.\\n\\n1. Out of the way, in a corner\\n     Of our dear old attic room,\\n   Where bunches of herbs from the hillside\\n     Shake ever a faint perfume,\\n   An oaken chest is standing,\\n     With hasp and padlock and key,\\n   Strong as the hands that made it\\n     On the other side of the sea.\\n\\n2. When the winter days are dreary,\\n     And we\\'re out of heart with life,\\n   Of its crowding cares aweary,\\n     And sick of its restless strife,\\n   We take a lesson in patience\\n     From the attic corner dim,\\n   Where the chest still holds its treasures,\\n     A warder faithful and grim.\\n\\n3. Robes of an antique fashion,\\n     Linen and lace and silk,\\n   That time has tinted with saffron,\\n     Though once they were white as milk;\\n   Wonderful baby garments,\\n     \\'Boidered with loving care\\n   By fingers that felt the pleasure,\\n     As they wrought the ruffles fair;\\n\\n4. A sword, with the red rust on it,\\n     That flashed in the battle tide,\\n   When from Lexington to Yorktown\\n     Sorely men\\'s souls were tried;\\n   A plumed chapeau and a buckle,\\n     And many a relic fine,\\n   And, an by itself, the sampler,\\n     Framed in with berry and vine.\\n\\n5. Faded the square of canvas,\\n     And dim is the silken thread,\\n   But I think of white hands dimpled,\\n     And a childish, sunny head;\\n   For here in cross and in tent stitch,\\n     In a wreath of berry and vine,\\n   She worked it a hundred years ago,\\n     \"Elizabeth, Aged Nine.\"\\n\\n6. In and out in the sunshine,\\n     The little needle flashed,\\n   And in and out on the rainy day,\\n     When the merry drops down plashed,\\n   As close she sat by her mother,\\n     The little Puritan maid,\\n   And did her piece in the sampler,\\n     While the other children played.\\n\\n7. You are safe in the beautiful heaven,\\n     \"Elizabeth, aged nine;\"\\n   But before you went you had troubles\\n     Sharper than any of mine.\\n   Oh, the gold hair turned with sorrow\\n     White as the drifted snow.\\n   And your tears dropped here where I\\'m standing,\\n     On this very plumed chapeau.\\n\\n8. When you put it away, its wearer\\n     Would need it nevermore,\\n   By a sword thrust learning the secrets\\n     God keeps on yonder shore;\\n   And you wore your grief like glory,\\n     You would not yield supine,\\n   Who wrought in your patient childhood,\\n     \"Elizabeth, Aged Nine.\"\\n\\n9. Out of the way, in a corner,\\n     With hasp and padlock and key,\\n   Stands the oaken chest of my fathers\\n     That came from over the sea;\\n   And the hillside herbs above it\\n     Shake odors fragrant and fine,\\n   And here on its lid is a garland\\n     To \"Elizabeth, aged nine.\"\\n\\n10. For love is of the immortal,\\n      And patience is sublime,\\n    And trouble a thing of every day,\\n      And touching every time;\\n    And childhood sweet and sunny,\\n      And womanly truth and grace,\\n    Ever call light life\\'s darkness\\n      And bless earth\\'s lowliest place.\\n                                      --Mrs. M. E. Sangster.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Ward\\'er, a keeper, a guard. 3. An-tique\\', old, ancient.\\nSaf\\'fron, a deep yellow. 4. Cha-peau\\', a hat. 8. Su-pine\\', listless. 10.\\nIm-mort\\'al, undying.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--6. Puritan. The Puritans were a religious sect who fled from\\npersecution in England, and afterwards settled the most of New England.\\n\\nA sampler is a needlework pattern; a species of fancywork formerly much in\\nvogue.\\n\\n\\n\\nLI. THE GOODNESS OF GOD.\\n\\n1. Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord, my God, thou art very great; thou\\nart clothed with honor and majesty: who coverest thyself with light as\\nwith a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; who layeth\\nthe beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his\\nchariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind; who maketh his angels\\nspirits, his ministers a flaming fire; who laid the foundations of the\\nearth, that it should not be removed forever.\\n\\n2. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood\\nabove the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder\\nthey hasted away. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys\\nunto the place which thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound\\nwhich they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.\\n\\n\\n3. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.\\nThey give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their\\nthirst. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which\\nsing among the branches. He watereth the hills from his chambers; the\\nearth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.\\n\\n4. He caused the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of\\nman, that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that maketh\\nglad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which\\nstrengtheneth man\\'s heart.\\n\\n5. The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he\\nhath planted, where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir\\ntrees are her house. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and\\nthe rocks for the conies.\\n\\n6. He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou\\nmakest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do\\ncreep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat\\nfrom God. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them\\ndown in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labor until\\nthe evening.\\n\\n7. O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all:\\nthe earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein\\nare things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the\\nships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. These\\nwait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.\\n\\n8. That thou givest them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are\\nfilled with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest\\naway their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth\\nthy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.\\n\\n9. The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice in\\nhis works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the\\nhills, and they smoke.\\n\\n10. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his\\nwonderful works to the children of men! And let them sacrifice the\\nsacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.\\n\\n11. O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds\\namong the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his\\nwondrous\\' works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice\\nthat seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and his strength; seek his face\\nevermore.\\n\\n12. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the\\njudgments of his mouth. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all\\nthe earth. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise\\nto my God while I have my being.\\n                                                 --Extracts from the Bible.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Found\\'ed, built, established. 3. Hab-i-ta\\' tion, place of\\nabode. 5. Ref \\'uge, shelter, protection. Co\\'ny, a kind of rabbit. 6.\\nAp-point\\'ed, ordained.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--5. Cedars of Lebanon. A species of cedar, of great magnificence,\\nformerly abundant in Mt. Lebanon and the Taurus Range in Asia Minor, but\\nnow almost entirely destroyed. The wood is durable and fragrant, and was\\nused in the construction of costly buildings, such as the palace of David\\nand Solomon\\'s Temple.\\n\\n7. Leviathan. This name is applied in the Old Testament to some huge water\\nanimal. In some cases it appears to mean the crocodile, but in others the\\nwhale or a large sea serpent.\\n\\n\\n\\nLII. MY MOTHER.\\n\\n1. Often into folly straying,\\n     O, my mother! how I\\'ve grieved her!\\n   Oft I\\'ve heard her for me praying,\\n     Till the gushing tears relieved her;\\n   And she gently rose and smiled,\\n   Whispering, \"God will keep my child.\"\\n\\n2. She was youthful then, and sprightly,\\n     Fondly on my father leaning,\\n   Sweet she spoke, her eyes shone brightly,\\n     And her words were full of meaning;\\n   Now, an autumn leaf decayed;\\n   I, perhaps, have made it fade.\\n\\n3. But, whatever ills betide thee,\\n     Mother, in them all I share;\\n   In thy sickness watch beside thee,\\n     And beside thee kneel in prayer.\\n   Best of mothers! on my breast\\n   Lean thy head, and sink to rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIII. THE HOUR OF PRAYER.\\n\\nFelicia Dorothea Hemans (b. 1794, d. 1835) was born in Liverpool, England.\\nHer maiden name was Browne. Her childhood was spent in Wales. Her first\\nvolume of poems was published in 1808; her second in 1812. In 1812 she was\\nmarried to Captain Hemans, but he left her about six years after their\\nmarriage, and they never again lived together. She went, with her five\\nsons, to reside with her mother, then living near St. Asaph, in North\\nWales. Mrs. Hemans then resumed her literary pursuits, and wrote much and\\nwell. Her poetry is smooth and graceful, and she excels in description.\\nMany of her poems are exceedingly beautiful.\\n\\n1. Child, amid the flowers at play,\\n   While the red light fades away;\\n   Mother, with thine earnest eye,\\n   Ever following silently;\\n   Father, by the breeze at eve\\n   Called thy harvest work to leave;\\n   Pray! Ere yet the dark hours be,\\n   Lift the heart, and bend the knee.\\n\\n2. Traveler, in the stranger\\'s land,\\n   Far from thine own household band;\\n   Mourner, haunted by the tone\\n   Of a voice from this world gone;\\n   Captive, in whose narrow cell\\n   Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;\\n   Sailor, on the darkening sea;\\n   Lift the heart and bend the knee.\\n\\n3. Warrior, that from battle won,\\n   Breathest now at set of sun;\\n   Woman, o\\'er the lowly slain\\n   Weeping on his burial plain;\\n   Ye that triumph, ye that sigh,\\n   Kindred by one holy tie,\\n   Heaven\\'s first star alike ye see;\\n   Lift the heart, and bend the knee.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIV. THE WILL.\\n\\nCharacters.--SWIPES, a brewer; CURRIE, a saddler; FRANK MILLINGTON; and\\nSQUIRE DRAWL.\\n\\nSwipes. A sober occasion, this, brother Currie. Who would have thought the\\nold lady was so near her end?\\n\\nCurrie. Ah! we must all die, brother Swipes; and those who live the\\nlongest outlive the most.\\n\\nSwipes. True, true; but, since we must die and leave our earthly\\npossessions, it is well that the law takes such good care of us. Had the\\nold lady her senses when she departed?\\n\\nCur. Perfectly, perfectly. Squire Drawl told me she read every word of the\\nwill aloud, and never signed her name better.\\n\\nSwipes. Had you any hint from the Squire what disposition she made of her\\nproperty?\\n\\nCur. Not a whisper; the Squire is as close as an underground tomb; but one\\nof the witnesses hinted to me that she had cut off her graceless nephew,\\nFrank, without a shilling.\\n\\nSwipes. Has she, good soul, has she? You know I come in,\\nthen, in right of my wife.\\n\\nCur. And I in my own right; and this is no doubt the reason why we have\\nbeen called to hear the reading of the will. Squire Drawl knows how things\\nshould be done, though he is as air-tight as one of your beer barrels. But\\nhere comes the young reprobate. He must be present, as a matter of course,\\nyou know. [Enter FRANK MILLINGTON.] Your servant, young gentleman. So your\\nbenefactress has left you at last.\\n\\nSwipes. It is a painful thing to part with old and good friends, Mr.\\nMillington.\\n\\nFrank. It is so, sir; but I could bear her loss better had I not so often\\nbeen ungrateful for her kindness. She was my only friend, and I knew not\\nher value.\\n\\nCur. It is too late to repent, Master Millington. You will now have a\\nchance to earn your own bread.\\n\\nSwipes. Ay, ay, or the sweat of your brow, as better people are obliged\\nto. You would make a fine brewer\\'s boy, if you were not too old.\\n\\nCur. Ay, or a saddler\\'s lackey, if held with a tight rein.\\n\\nFrank. Gentlemen, your remarks imply that my aunt has treated me as I\\ndeserved. I am above your insults, and only hope you will bear your\\nfortune as modestly as I shall mine submissively. I shall retire. [Going:\\nHe meets SQUIRE DRAWL.]\\n\\nSquire. Stop, stop, young man. We must have your presence. Good morning,\\ngentlemen; you are early on the ground.\\n\\nCur. I hope the Squire is well to-day.\\n\\nSquire. Pretty comfortable, for an invalid.\\n\\nSwipes. I trust the damp air has not affected your lungs again.\\n\\nSquire. No, I believe not. But, since the heirs at law are all convened, I\\nshall now proceed to open the last will and testament of your deceased\\nrelative, according to law.\\n\\nSwipes. [While the SQUIRE is breaking the seal,] It is a trying thing to\\nleave all one\\'s possessions, Squire; in this manner.\\n\\nCur. It really makes me feel melancholy when I look around and see\\neverything but the venerable owner of these goods. Well did the Preacher\\nsay, \"All is vanity.\"\\n\\nSquire. Please to be seated, gentlemen. [He puts on his spectacles and\\nbegins to read slowly.] \"Imprirmis; whereas, my nephew, Francis\\nMillington, by his disobedience and ungrateful conduct, has shown himself\\nunworthy of my bounty, and incapable of managing my large estate, I do\\nhereby give and bequeath all my houses, farms, stocks, bonds, moneys, and\\nproperty, both personal and real, to my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of\\nMalt Street, brewer, and Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler.\" [The\\nSQUIRE here takes off his spectacles, and begins to wipe them very\\nleisurely.]\\n\\nSwipes. Generous creature! kind soul! I always loved her!\\n\\nCur. She was good, she was kind;--and, brother Swipes, when we divide, I\\nthink I\\'ll take the mansion house.\\n\\nSwipes. Not so fast, if you please, Mr. Currie. My wife has long had her\\neye upon that, and must have it.\\n\\nCur. There will be two words to that bargain, Mr. Swipes. And, besides, I\\nought to have the first choice. Did I not lend her a new chaise every time\\nshe wished to ride? And who knows what influence--\\n\\nSwipes. Am I not named first in her will? and did I not furnish her with\\nmy best small beer for more than six months? And who knows--\\n\\nFrank. Gentlemen, I must leave you. [Going.] Squire. [Putting on his\\nspectacles very deliberately.] Pray, gentlemen, keep your seats, I have\\nnot done yet. Let me see; where was I? Ay, \"All my property, both personal\\nand real, to my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of Malt Street, brewer,\"--\\n\\nSwipes. Yes!\\n\\nSquire. \"And Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler,\"\\n\\nCur. Yes!\\n\\nSquire. \"To have and to hold, IN TRUST, for the sole and exclusive benefit\\nof my nephew, Francis Millington, until he shall have attained the age of\\ntwenty-one years, by which time I hope he will have so far reformed his\\nevil habits, as that he may safely be intrusted with the large fortune\\nwhich I hereby bequeath to him.\"\\n\\nSwipes. What is all this? You don\\'t mean that we are humbugged? In trust!\\nHow does that appear? Where is it?\\n\\nSquire. There; in two words of as good old English as I ever penned.\\n\\nCur. Pretty well, too, Mr. Squire, if we must be sent for to be made a\\nlaughingstock of. She shall pay for every ride she has had out of my\\nchaise, I promise you.\\n\\nSwipes. And for every drop of my beer. Fine times, if two sober,\\nhard-working citizens are to be brought here to be made the sport of a\\ngraceless profligate. But we will manage his property for him, Mr. Currie;\\nwe will make him feel that trustees are not to be trifled with.\\n\\nCur. That we will.\\n\\nSquire.

THE NOSE AND THE EYES.\\n\\nWilliam Cowper (b. 1731, d. 1800) was the son of an English clergyman, and\\nwas born in Great Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, England. He was sent to\\nWestminster School when he was ten years of age, and he remained there, a\\ndiligent student, eight years. He then studied law, and was admitted to\\nthe bar, but he never practiced his profession. He was appointed to a\\nclerkship in the House of Lords when he was about thirty years old, but he\\nnever entered upon the discharge of his duties. He became insane, and was\\nsent to a private asylum. After his recovery, he found a home in the\\nfamily of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of this gentleman, he resided\\nwith the widow till her death--most of the time at Olney. His first\\nwriting\\'s were published in 1782. \"The Task,\" some hymns, a number of\\nminor poems, and his translations or Homer, composed his published works.\\nHis insanity returned at times, and darkened a pure and gentle life at its\\nclose.\\n\\n1. Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;\\n     The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;\\n   The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,\\n     To which the said spectacles ought to belong.\\n\\n2. So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause,\\n     With a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning,\\n   While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,\\n     So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.\\n\\n3. \"In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,\\n     And your lordship,\" he said, \"will undoubtedly find,\\n   That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,\\n     Which amounts to possession, time out of mind.\"\\n\\n4. Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,\\n     \"Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle\\n   As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,\\n     Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.\\n\\n5. \"Again, would your lordship a moment suppose\\n     (\\'T is a case that has happened, and may happen again)\\n   That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,\\n     Pray, who would or who could wear spectacles then?\\n\\n6. \"On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,\\n     With a reasoning the court will never condemn,\\n   That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,\\n     And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.\"\\n\\n7. Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),\\n     He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:\\n   But what were his arguments, few people know,\\n     For the court did not think them equally wise.\\n\\n8. So his lordship decreed, with a grave, solemn tone,\\n     Decisive and clear, without one if or but,\\n   That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,\\n     By daylight or candlelight,--Eyes should be shut.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Ar\\'gued, discussed, treated by reasoning. Dis-cern\\'ing\\n(pro. diz-zern\\'ing), marking as different, distinguishing, 3. Be-half\\',\\nsupport, defense. 8. De-creed\\', determined judicially by authority,\\nordered,\\n\\n\\n\\nLVI. AN ICEBERG.\\n\\nLouis Legrand Noble (b. 1813, d. 1882) was horn in Otsetgo County, New\\nYork. When twelve years of age, he removed with his family to the wilds of\\nMichigan, but after the death of his father he returned to New York to\\nstudy for the ministry, which he entered in 1840. About this time he\\npublished his first productions, two Indian romances in the form of poems,\\nentitled \"Pewatem\" and \"Nimahmin.\" Mr. Noble lived for a time in North\\nCarolina, and later at Catskill on the Hudson, where he became a warm\\nfriend of the artist Cole. After the latter\\'s death he wrote a memorial of\\nhim. Other works of this author are \"The Hours, and other Poems,\" and\\n\"After Icebergs with a Painter,\" from which this selection is taken.\\n\\n1. We have just passed a fragment of some one of the surrounding icebergs\\nthat had amused us. It bore the resemblance of a huge polar bear, reposing\\nupon the base of an inverted cone, with a twist of a seashell, and\\nwhirling slowly round and round. The ever-attending green water, with its\\naerial clearness, enabled us to see its spiral folds and horns as they\\nhung suspended in the deep.\\n\\n2. The bear, a ten-foot mass in tolerable proportion, seemed to be\\nregularly beset by a pack of hungry little swells. First, one would take\\nhim on the haunch, then whip back into the sea over his tail and between\\nhis legs. Presently a bolder swell would rise and pitch into his back with\\na ferocity that threatened instant destruction. It only washed his satin\\nfleece the whiter.\\n\\n3. While Bruin was turning to look the daring assailant in the face, the\\nrogue had pitched himself back into his cave. No sooner that, than a very\\nbulldog of a billow would attack him in the face. The serenity with which\\nthe impertinent assault was borne was complete. It was but a puff of\\nsilvery dust, powdering his mane with fresher brightness. Nothing would be\\nleft of bull but a little froth of all the foam displayed in the fierce\\nonset. He too would turn and scud into his hiding place.\\n\\n4. Persistent little waves! After a dash, singly, all around, upon the\\ncommon enemy, as if by some silent agreement underwater, they would all\\nrush on at once, with their loudest roar and shaggiest foam, and overwhelm\\npoor bear so completely that nothing less might be expected than to behold\\nhim broken in four quarters, and floating helplessly asunder. Mistaken\\nspectators! Although, by his momentary rolling and plunging, he was\\nevidently aroused, yet neither Bruin nor his burrow was at all the worse\\nfor all the wear and washing.\\n\\n5. The deep fluting, the wrinkled folds, and cavities, over and through\\nwhich the green and silvery water rushed back into the sea, rivaled the\\nmost exquisite sculpture. And nature not only gives her marbles, with the\\nfinest lines, the most perfect lights and shades, she colors them also.\\nShe is no monochromist, but polychroic, imparting such touches of dove\\ntints, emerald, and azure as she bestows upon her gems and skies.\\n\\n6. We are bearing up under the big berg as closely as we dare. To our\\ndelight, what we have been wishing and watching for is actually taking\\nplace: loud explosions, with heavy falls of ice, followed by the\\ncataract-like roar, and the high, thin seas, wheeling away beautifully\\ncrested with sparkling foam. If it is possible, imagine the effect upon\\nthe beholder: this precipice of ice, with tremendous cracking, is falling\\ntoward us with a majestic and awful motion.\\n\\n7. Down sinks the long water line into the black deep; down go the\\nporcelain crags and galleries of glassy sculpture--a speechless and awful\\nbaptism. Now it pauses, and returns: up rise sculptures and crags\\nstreaming with the shining white brine; up comes the great encircling\\nline, followed by things new and strange--crags, niches, balconies, and\\ncaves; up, up, it rises, higher and higher still, crossing the very breast\\nof the grand ice, and all bathed with rivulets of gleaming foam. Over goes\\nthe summit, ridge, pinnacles, and all, standing off obliquely in the\\nopposite air. Now it pauses in its upward roll: back it comes again,\\ncracking, cracking, cracking, \"groaning out harsh thunder\" as it comes,\\nand threatening to burst, like a mighty bomb, into millions of glittering\\nfragments. The spectacle is terrific and magnificent. Emotion is\\nirrepressible, and peals of wild hurrah burst forth from all.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Cone, a solid body having a circular base, from which it\\ntapers gradually to a point. 2. Swells, waves. 3. Se-ren\\'i-ty, quietness,\\ncalmness. 5. Ex\\'qui-site, exceedingly nice, giving rare satisfaction.\\nSculp\\'ture, carved work. Mon\\'o-chro-mist, one who paints in a single\\ncolor. Pol-y-chro\\'ic, given to the use of many colors. 7. Pin\\'na-cles,\\nhigh, spirelike points. Ob-lique\\'ly, slantingly. Ir-re-press\\'i-ble, not to\\nbe restrained.\\n\\n\\nNotes--Only about one eighth of an iceberg appears above the surface of\\nthe water. When one side of it grows heavier than another, through unequal\\nmelting and the action of the waves, the whole mass rolls over in the\\nwater in the manner so well described in this lesson.\\n\\n\\n\\nLVII. ABOUT QUAIL.\\n\\nWilliam Post Hawes (b. 1803, d.1842) was born in New York City. and was a\\ngraduate of Columbia College. He was a lawyer by profession. His writings\\nconsist mainly of essays, contributed to various newspapers and magazines,\\nand show great descriptive power. He was a frequent contributor to the\\n\"Spirit of the Times,\" under the title of \"Cypress, Jr.,\" on various\\nsporting topics. After his death a collection of his writings was\\npublished in two volumes, entitled, \"Sporting Scenes\" and \"Sundry\\nSketches.\"\\n\\n1. The quail is peculiarly a domestic bird, and is attached to his\\nbirthplace and the home of his forefathers. The various members of the\\naquatic families educate their children in the cool summer of the far\\nnorth, and bathe their warm bosoms in July in the iced waters of Hudson\\nBay; but when Boreas scatters the rushes where they had builded their\\nbedchambers, they desert their fatherland, and fly to disport in the sunny\\nwaters of the south.\\n\\n2. The songsters of the woodland, when their customary crops of insects\\nand berries are cut off in the fall, gather themselves to renew their\\nloves and get married in more genial climes. Presently, the groves so\\nvocal, and the sky so full, shall be silent and barren. The \"melancholy\\ndays\" will soon be here; only thou, dear Bob White, wilt remain.\\n\\n3. The quail is the bird for me. He is no rover, no emigrant. He stays at\\nhome, and is identified with the soil. Where the farmer works, he lives,\\nand loves, and whistles. In budding springtime, and in scorching\\nsummer--in bounteous autumn, and in barren winter, his voice is heard from\\nthe same bushy hedge fence, and from his customary cedars. Cupidity and\\ncruelty may drive him to the woods, and to seek more quiet seats; but be\\nmerciful and kind to him, and he will visit your barnyard, and sing for\\nyou upon the boughs of the apple tree by your gateway.\\n\\n4. When warm May first wooes the young flowers to open and receive her\\nbreath, then begin the cares and responsibilitie of wedded life. Away fly\\nthe happy pair to seek some grassy tussock, where, safe from the eye of\\nthe hawk and the nose of the fox, they may rear their expectant brood in\\npeace.\\n\\n5. Oats harvest arrives, and the fields are waving with yellow grain. Now\\nbe wary, O kind-hearted cradler, and tread not into those pure white eggs\\nready to burst with life! Soon there is a peeping sound heard, and lo! a\\nproud mother walketh magnificently in the midst of her children,\\nscratching and picking, and teaching them how to swallow. Happy she, if\\nshe may be permitted to bring them up to maturity, and uncompelled to\\nrenew her joys in another nest.\\n\\n6. The assiduities of a mother have a beauty and a sacredness about them\\nthat command respect and reverence in all animal nature, human or\\ninhuman--what a lie does that word carry--except, perhaps, in monsters,\\ninsects, and fish. I never yet heard of the parental tenderness of a\\ntrout, eating up his little baby, nor of the filial gratitude of a spider,\\nnipping the life out of his gray-headed father, and usurping his web.\\n\\n7. But if you would see the purest, the sincerest, the most affecting\\npiety of a parent\\'s love, startle a young family of quails, and watch the\\nconduct of the mother. She will not leave you. No, not she. But she will\\nfall at your feet, uttering a noise which none but a distressed mother can\\nmake, and she will run, and flutter, and seem to try to be caught, and\\ncheat your outstretched hand, and affect to be wing-broken and wounded,\\nand yet have just strength to tumble along, until she has drawn you,\\nfatigued, a safe distance from her threatened children and the young hopes\\nof her heart; and then will she mount, whirring with glad strength, and\\naway through the maze of trees you have not seen before, like a close-shot\\nbullet, fly to her skulking infants,\\n\\n8. Listen now. Do you hear those three half-plaintive notes, quickly and\\nclearly poured out? She is calling the boys and girls together. She sings\\nnot now \"Bob White!\" nor \"Ah! Bob White!\" That is her husband\\'s love call,\\nor his trumpet blast of defiance. But she calls sweetly and softly for her\\nlost children. Hear them \"Peep! peep! peep!\" at the welcome voice of their\\nmother\\'s love! They are coming together. Soon the whole family will meet\\nagain.\\n\\n9. It is a foul sin to disturb them; but retread your devious way, and let\\nher hear your coming footsteps, breaking down the briers, as you renew the\\ndanger. She is quiet. Not a word is passed between the fearful fugitives.\\nNow, if you have the heart to do it, lie low, keep still, and imitate the\\ncall of the hen quail. O mother! mother! how your heart would die if you\\ncould witness the deception! The little ones raise up their trembling\\nheads, and catch comfort and imagined safety from the sound. \"Peep! peep!\"\\nThey come to you, straining their little eyes, and, clustering together\\nand answering, seem to say, \"Where is she? Mother! mother! we are here!\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. A-quat\\'ic, frequenting the water. 2. Vo\\'cal, having a\\nvoice. 3. I-den\\'ti-fied, united. Cu-pid\\'i-ty, eager desire to possess\\nsomething. 4. Tus\\'sock, a tuft of grass or twigs. 5. Cra\\'dler, one who\\nuses a cradle, which is an instrument attached to a scythe in cutting\\ngrain. 6. U-surp\\'ing, seizing and holding in possession by force. 7.\\nAf-fect\\', to pretend. 9. De\\'vi-ous, winding.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--l. Boreas is the name which the ancient Greeks gave to\\nthe north wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nLVIII. THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.\\n\\n1. By the flow of the inland river,\\n     Whence the fleets of iron have fled,\\n   Where the blades of the grave grass quiver,\\n     Asleep are the ranks of the dead;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Under the one, the Blue;\\n         Under the other, the Gray.\\n\\n2. These, in the robings of glory,\\n     Those, in the gloom of defeat,\\n   All, with the battle blood gory,\\n     In the dusk of eternity meet;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Under the laurel, the Blue;\\n         Under the willow, the Gray.\\n\\n3. From the silence of sorrowful hours,\\n     The desolate mourners go,\\n   Lovingly laden with flowers,\\n     Alike for the friend and the foe;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Under the roses, the Blue;\\n         Under the lilies, the Gray.\\n\\n4. So, with an equal splendor,\\n     The morning sun rays fall,\\n   With a touch, impartially tender,\\n     On the blossoms blooming for all;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Broidered with gold, the Blue;\\n         Mellowed with gold, the Gray.\\n\\n5. So, when the summer calleth,\\n     On forest and field of grain,\\n   With an equal murmur falleth\\n     The cooling drip of the rain;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Wet with the rain, the Blue;\\n         Wet with the rain, the Gray.\\n\\n6. Sadly, but not with upbraiding,\\n     The generous deed was done:\\n   In the storm of the years that are fading,\\n     No braver battle was won;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Under the blossoms, the Blue;\\n         Under the garlands, the Gray.\\n\\n7. No more shall the war cry sever,\\n     Or the winding rivers be red;\\n   They banish our anger forever,\\n     When they laurel the graves of our dead;--\\n       Under the sod and the dew,\\n         Waiting the judgment day;\\n       Love and tears, for the Blue;\\n         Tears and love, for the Gray.\\n                                          --F. M. Finch.\\n\\nNOTE.--The above touching little poem first appeared in the \"Atlantic\\nMonthly\" in September, 1867. It commemorates the noble action on the part\\nof the women at Columbus, Miss., who in decorating the graves strewed\\nflowers impartially on those of the Confederate and of the Federal\\nsoldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIX. THE MACHINIST\\'S RETURN.\\n\\n[Adapted from a letter written by a correspondent of the Washington\\n\"Capital.\"]\\n\\n1. On our way from Springfield to Boston, a stout, black-whiskered man\\nsat immediately in front of me, in the drawing-room car, whose maneuvers\\nwere a source of constant amusement. He would get up every five minutes,\\nhurry away to the narrow passage leading to the door of the car, and\\ncommence laughing in the most violent manner, continuing that healthful\\nexercise until he observed that some one was watching him, when he would\\nreturn to his seat.\\n\\n2. As we neared Boston these demonstrations increased in frequency and\\nviolence, but the stranger kept his seat and chuckled to himself. He\\nshifted the position of his two portmanteaus, or placed them on the seat\\nas if he was getting ready to leave. As we were at least twenty-five miles\\nfrom Boston, such early preparations seemed extremely ridiculous. He\\nbecame so excited at last that he could not keep his secret. Some one must\\nbe made a confidant; and as I happened to be the nearest to him, he\\nselected me.\\n\\n3. Turning around suddenly, and rocking himself to and fro in his chair,\\nhe said, \"I have been away from home three years. Have been in Europe. My\\nfolks don\\'t expect me for three months yet, but I got through and started.\\nI telegraphed them at the last station--they\\'ve got the dispatch by this\\ntime.\" As he said this he rubbed his hands, and changed the portmanteau on\\nhis left to the right, and then the one on the right to the left.\\n\\n4. \"Have you a wife?\" said I. \"Yes, and three children,\" was the answer.\\nHe then got up and folded his overcoat anew, and hung it over the back of\\nthe seat. \"You are somewhat nervous just now, are you not?\" said I.\\n\\n5. \"Well, I should think so,\" he replied. \"I have n\\'t slept soundly for a\\nweek. Do you know,\" he went on, speaking in a low tone, \"I am almost\\ncertain this train will run off the track and break my neck before I get\\nto Boston. I have had too much good luck lately for one man. It can\\'t\\nlast. It rains so hard, sometimes, that you think it\\'s never going to\\nstop; then it shines so bright you think it\\'s always going to shine; and\\njust as you are settle in either belief, you are knocked over by a change,\\nto show you that you know nothing about it.\"\\n\\n6. \"Well, according to your philosophy,\" I said, \"you will continue to\\nhave sunshine because you are expecting a storm.\" \"Perhaps so,\" he\\nreplied; \"but it is curious that the only thing which makes me think I\\nshall get through safe is, I fear that I shall not.\"\\n\\n7. \"I am a machinist,\" he continued; \"I made a discovery; nobody believed\\nin it; I spent all my money in trying to bring it out; I mortgaged my\\nhome--everything went. Everybody laughed at me--everybody but my wife. She\\nsaid she would work her fingers off before I should give it up. I went to\\nEngland. At first I met with no encouragement whatever, and came very near\\njumping off London Bridge. I went into a workshop to earn money enough to\\ncome home with: there I met the man I wanted. To make a long story short,\\nI\\'ve brought home 50,000 Pounds with me, and here I am.\"\\n\\n8. \"Good!\" I exclaimed. \"Yes,\" said he, \"and the best of it is, she knows\\nnothing about it. She has been disappointed so often that I concluded I\\nwould not write to her about my unexpected good luck. When I got my money,\\nthough, I started for home at once.\"\\n\\n9. \"And now, I suppose, you will make her happy?\" \"Happy!\" he replied;\\n\"why, you don\\'t know anything about it! She\\'s worked night and day since I\\nhave been in England, trying to support herself and the children decently.\\nThey paid her thirteen cents apiece for making shirts, and that\\'s the way\\nshe has lived half the time. She\\'ll come down to the depot to meet me in a\\ngingham dress and a shawl a hundred years old, and she\\'ll think she\\'s\\ndressed up! Perhaps she won\\'t have any fine dresses in a week or so, eh?\\'\"\\n10. The stranger then strode down the passageway again, and getting in a\\ncorner where he seemed to suppose that he was out of sight, went through\\nthe strangest pantomime,--laughing putting his mouth into the drollest\\nshapes, and swinging himself back and forth in the limited space.\\n\\n11. As the train was going into the depot, I placed myself on the platform\\nof the car in front of the one in which I had been riding, and opposite\\nthe stranger, who, with a portmanteau in each hand, was standing on the\\nlowest step, ready to jump to the ground. I looked from his face to the\\nfaces of the people before us, but saw no sign of recognition. Suddenly he\\ncried, \"There they are!\"\\n\\n12. Then he laughed outright, but in a hysterical way, as he looked over\\nthe crowd in front of him. I followed his eye and saw, some distance back,\\nas if crowded out by the well-dressed and elbowing throng, a little woman\\nin a faded dress and a well-worn hat, with a face almost painful in its\\nintense but hopeful expression, glancing rapidly from window to window as\\nthe coaches passed by.\\n\\n13. She had not seen the stranger, but a moment after she caught his eye.\\nIn another instant he had jumped to the platform with his two\\nportmanteaus, and, pushing his way through the crowd, he rushed towards\\nthe place where she was standing. I think I never saw a face assume so\\nmany different expressions in so short a time as did that of the little\\nwoman while her husband was on his way to meet her.\\n\\n14. She was not pretty,--on the contrary, she was very plain-looking; but\\nsomehow I felt a big lump rise in my throat as I watched her. She was\\ntrying to laugh, but, God bless her, how completely she failed in the\\nattempt! Her mouth got into the position to laugh, but it never moved\\nafter that, save to draw down at the corners and quiver, while her eyes\\nblinked so fast that I suspect she only caught occasional glimpses of the\\nbroad-shouldered fellow who elbowed his way so rapidly toward her.\\n\\n15. As he drew close, and dropped the portmanteaus, she turned to one\\nside, and covered her face with her hands; and thus she was when the\\nstrong man gathered her up in his arms as if she were a child, and held\\nher sobbing to his breast.\\n\\n16. There were enough staring at them, heaven knows; so I turned my eyes\\naway a moment, and then I saw two boys in threadbare roundabouts standing\\nnear, wiping their eyes on their sleeves, and bursting into tears anew at\\nevery fresh demonstration on the part of their mother. When I looked at\\nthe stranger again he had his hat drawn over his eyes; but his wife was\\nlooking up at him, and it seemed as if the pent-up tears of those weary\\nmonths of waiting were streaming through her eyelids.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ma-neu\\'vers, movements. 2. Dem-on-stra\\'-tions, expression\\nof the feelings by outward signs. Port-man\\'teau (pro. port-man\\'to), a\\ntraveling bag, usually made of leather.

His father, a Moravian preacher, sent him to a Moravian school\\nat Fulneck, Yorkshire, England, to be educated. In 1794 he started \"The\\nSheffield Iris,\" a weekly paper, which he edited, with marked ability,\\ntill 1825. He was fined and imprisoned twice for publishing articles\\ndecided to be seditious. His principal poetical works are \"The World\\nbefore the Flood,\" \"Greenland,\" \"The West Indies,\" \"The Wanderer in\\nSwitzerland,\" \"The Pelican Island,\" and \"Original Hymns, for Public,\\nPrivate, and Social Devotion.\" Mr. Montgomery\\'s style is generally too\\ndiffuse; but its smoothness and the evident sincerity of his emotions have\\nmade many of his hymns and minor poems very popular. A pension of 300\\nPounds a year was granted to him in 1833.\\n\\n1. \"Make way for Liberty!\" he cried;\\n   Made way for Liberty, and died!\\n\\n2. In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,\\n   A living wall, a human wood!\\n   A wall, where every conscious stone\\n   Seemed to its kindred thousands grown;\\n   A rampart all assaults to bear,\\n   Till time to dust their frames should wear\\n   A wood like that enchanted grove,\\n   In which, with fiends, Rinaldo strove,\\n   Where every silent tree possessed\\n   A spirit prisoned in its breast,\\n   Which the first stroke of coming strife\\n   Would startle into hideous life:\\n   So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,\\n   A living wall, a human wood!\\n\\n3. Impregnable their front appears,\\n   All horrent with projected spears,\\n   Whose polished points before them shine,\\n   From flank to flank, one brilliant line,\\n   Bright as the breakers\\' splendors run\\n   Along the billows to the sun.\\n\\n4. Opposed to these, a hovering band,\\n   Contending for their native laud;\\n   Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke\\n   From manly necks the ignoble yoke,\\n   And forged their fetters into swords,\\n   On equal terms to fight their lords;\\n   And what insurgent rage had gained,\\n   In many a mortal fray maintained:\\n   Marshaled once more at Freedom\\'s call,\\n   They came to conquer or to fall,\\n   Where he who conquered, he who fell.\\n   Was deemed a dead or living Tell!\\n\\n5. And now the work of life and death\\n   Hung on the passing of a breath;\\n   The fire of conflict burned within;\\n   The battle trembled to begin;\\n   Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,\\n   Point for attack was nowhere found;\\n   Where\\'er the impatient Switzers gazed,\\n   The unbroken line of lances blazed;\\n   That line \\'t were suicide to meet,\\n   And perish at their tyrants\\' feet;\\n   How could they rest within their graves,\\n   And leave their homes the home of slaves?\\n   Would they not feel their children tread\\n   With clanking chains above their head?\\n\\n6. It must not be: this day, this hour,\\n   Annihilates the oppressor\\'s power\\n   All Switzerland is in the field,\\n   She will not fly, she can not yield;\\n   Few were the numbers she could boast,\\n   But every freeman was a host,\\n   And felt as though himself were he\\n   On whose sole arm hung victory.\\n\\n7. It did depend on one, indeed:\\n   Behold him! Arnold Winkelried!\\n   There sounds not to the trump of fame\\n   The echo of a nobler name.\\n   Unmarked he stood amid the throng,\\n   In rumination deep and long,\\n   Till you might see with sudden grace,\\n   The very thought come o\\'er his face;\\n   And by the motion of his form:\\n   Anticipate the bursting storm;\\n   And by the uplifting of his brow,\\n   Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.\\n   But \\'t was no sooner thought than done;\\n   The field was in a moment won.\\n\\n8. \"Make way for Liberty!\" he cried:\\n   Then ran, with arms extended wide,\\n   As if his dearest friend to clasp;\\n   Ten spears he swept within his grasp:\\n   \"Make way for Liberty!\" he cried,\\n   Their keen points met from side to side;\\n   He bowed among them like a tree,\\n   And thus made way for Liberty.\\n\\n9. Swift to the breach his comrades fly;\\n   \"Make way for Liberty!\" they cry,\\n   And through the Austrian phalanx dart,\\n   As rushed the spears through Arnold\\'s heart;\\n   While instantaneous as his fall,\\n   Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all.\\n   An earthquake could not overthrow\\n   A city with a surer blow.\\n\\n10. Thus Switzerland again was free,\\n    Thus Death made way for Liberty!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Pha\\'lanx, a body of troops formed in close array.\\nCon\\'scious, sensible, knowing. Kin\\'dred, those of like nature, relatives.\\nRam\\'part, that which defends from assault, a bulwark. 3. Im-preg\\'na-ble,\\nthat can not be moved or shaken. Hor\\'rent, standing out like bristles. 4.\\nIn-sur\\'gent, rising in opposition to authority. 13. An-ni\\'hi-lates,\\ndestroys. 7. Ru-mi-na\\'tion, the act of musing, meditation. 9. Breach, a\\ngap or opening made by breaking.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The incident related in this poem is one of actual occurrence, and\\ntook place at the battle of Sempach, fought in 1386 A.D., between only\\n1,300 Swiss and a large army of Austrians. The latter had obtained\\npossession of a narrow pass in the mountains, from which it seemed\\nimpossible to dislodge them until Arnold von Winkelried made a breach in\\ntheir line, as narrated.\\n\\nRinaldo is a knight in Tasso\\'s \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (Canto XVIII, 17-40),\\nwho enters an enchanted wood, and, by cutting down a tree in spite of the\\nnymphs and phantoms that endeavor in every way to stop him, breaks the\\nspell; the Christian army are thus enabled to enter the grove and obtain\\ntimber for their engines of war.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXI. THE ENGLISH SKYLARK.\\n\\nElihu Burritt (b. 1810, d. 1879). \"the learned blacksmith,\" was born in\\nNew Britain, Conn. His father was a shoemaker. Having received only a\\nlimited amount of instruction at the district school, he was apprenticed\\nto a blacksmith about 1827. During his apprenticeship he labored hard at\\nself-instruction. He worked at his trade many years, from ten to twelve\\nhours each day, but managed, in the meantime to acquire a knowledge of\\nmany ancient and modern languages. He made translations from several of\\nthese, which were published in the \"American Eclectic Review.\" In 1844 he\\ncommenced the publication of \"The Christian Citizen.\" His leading literary\\nworks are \"Sparks from the Anvil,\" \"A Voice from the Forge,\" \"Peace\\nPapers,\" and \"Walks to John o\\' Groat\\'s House.\" From the last of these the\\nfollowing selection is abridged.\\n\\n1. Take it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals the English lark in\\nheart or voice, for both unite to make it the sweetest, the happiest, the\\nwelcomest singer that was ever winged, like the high angels of God\\'s love.\\nIt is the living ecstasy of joy when it mounts up into its \"glorious\\nprivacy of light.\"\\n\\n2. On the earth it is timid, silent, and bashful, as if not at home, and\\nnot sure of its right to be there at all. It is rather homely withal,\\nhaving nothing in feather, feature, or form to attract notice. It is\\nseemingly made to be heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom addressed to\\nchildren when getting noisy.\\n\\n3. Its mission is music, and it floods a thousand acres of the blue sky\\nwith it several times a day. Out of that palpitating speck of living joy\\nthere wells forth a sea of twittering ecstasy upon the morning and evening\\nair. It does not ascend by gyrations, like the eagle and birds of prey. It\\nmounts up like a human aspiration.\\n\\n4. It seems to spread its wings and to be lifted straight upwards out of\\nsight by the afflatus of its own happy heart. To pour out this in\\nundulating rivulets of rhapsody is apparently the only motive of its\\nascension. This it is that has made it so loved of all generations.\\n\\n5. It is the singing angel of man\\'s nearest heaven, whose vital breath is\\nmusic. Its sweet warbling is only the metrical palpitation of its life of\\njoy. It goes up over the rooftrees of the rural hamlet on the wings of its\\nsong, as if to train the human soul to trial flights heavenward.\\n\\n6. Never did the Creator put a voice of such volume into so small a living\\nthing. It is a marvel--almost a miracle. In a still hour you can hear it\\nat nearly a mile\\'s distance. When its form is lost in the hazy lace work\\nof the sun\\'s rays above, it pours down upon you all the thrilling\\nsemitones of its song as distinctly as if it were warbling to you in your\\nwindow.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ec\\'sta-sy, overmastering joy, rapture. 2. Ax\\'i-om, a\\nself-evident truth. 3. Pal\\'pi-tat-ing, throbbing, fluttering. Wells,\\npours, flows. Gy-ra\\'tions, circular or spiral motions. 4. Af--fla\\'tus,\\nbreath, inspiration. Un\\'du-la-ting, rising and falling like waves.\\nRhap\\'so-dy, that which is uttered in a disconnected way under strong\\nexcitement. Gen-er-a\\'tion, the mass of beings at one period. 5.\\nMet\\'ric-al, arranged in measures, as poetry and music. Roof \\'tree, the\\nbeam in the angle of a roof, hence the roof itself. Ham\\'let, a little\\ncluster of houses.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXII. HOW SLEEP THE BRAVE.\\n\\nWilliam Collins (b. 1721, d. 1759) was born at Chichester, England. He was\\neducated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1745, he went to London as a\\nliterary adventurer, and there won the esteem of Dr. Johnson. His \"Odes\"\\nwere published in 1746, but were not popular. He was subsequently relieved\\nfrom pecuniary embarrassment by a legacy of 2,000 Pounds from a maternal\\nuncle; but he soon became partially insane, and was for some time confined\\nin an asylum for lunatics. He afterwards retired to Chichester, where he\\nwas cared for by his sister until his death.\\n\\n1. How sleep the brave who sink to rest\\n   By all their country\\'s wishes blessed!\\n   When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,\\n   Returns to deck their hallowed mold,\\n   She there shall dress a sweeter sod\\n   Than Fancy\\'s feet have ever trod.\\n\\n2. By fairy hands their knell is rung;\\n   By forms unseen their dirge is sung;\\n   There honor comes a pilgrim gray,\\n   To bless the turf that wraps their clay;\\n   And Freedom shall awhile repair\\n   To dwell a weeping hermit there!\\n\\n\\n\\nLXIII. THE RAINBOW.\\n\\nJohn Keble (b. 1792. d. 1866) was born near Fairfax, Gloucestershire,\\nEngland. He graduated at Oxford with remarkably high honors, and\\nafterwards was appointed to the professorship of poetry in that\\nuniversity. Since his death, Keble College, at Oxford, has been erected to\\nhis memory. In 1835, he became vicar of Hursley and rector of Otterbourne,\\nand held these livings until his death. His most famous work is \"The\\nChristian Year,\" a collection of sacred poems.\\n\\n1. A fragment of a rainbow bright\\n     Through the moist air I see,\\n   All dark and damp on yonder height,\\n     All bright and clear to me.\\n\\n2. An hour ago the storm was here,\\n     The gleam was far behind;\\n   So will our joys and grief appear,\\n     When earth has ceased to blind.\\n\\n3. Grief will be joy if on its edge\\n     Fall soft that holiest ray,\\n   Joy will be grief if no faint pledge\\n     Be there of heavenly day.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXIV. SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS.\\n\\nDaniel Webster (b. 1782, d. 1852) was born in Salisbury, N.H. He spent a\\nfew months of his boyhood at Phillips Academy, Exeter, but fitted for\\ncollege under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boscawen, N.H. He graduated from\\nDartmouth College in 1801. He taught school several terms, during and\\nafter his college course. In 1805, he was admitted to the bar in Boston,\\nand practiced law in New Hampshire for the succeeding eleven years. In\\n1812, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. In\\n1816, he removed to Boston, and in 1827 was elected to the United States\\nSenate, which position he held for twelve years. In 1841, he was appointed\\nSecretary of State. He returned to the Senate in 1845. In 1850, he was\\nreappointed Secretary of State and continued in office until his death. He\\ndied at his residence, in Marshfield, Mass. Mr. Webster\\'s fame rests\\nchiefly on his state papers and speeches. As a speaker he was dignified\\nand stately, using clear, pure English. During all his life he took great\\ninterest in agriculture, and was very fond of outdoor sports.\\n\\n1. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my\\nheart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that, in the beginning, we aimed\\nnot at independence. But\\n\\n   \"There\\'s a divinity that shapes our ends.\"\\n\\nThe injustice of England has driven us to arms; and blinded to her own\\ninterest, she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now within\\nour grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why then\\nshould we defer the declaration? Is any man so weak as now to hope for a\\nreconciliation with England, which shall leave either safety to the\\ncountry and its liberties, or security to his own life and his own honor!\\nAre not you, sir, who sit in that chair, is not he, our venerable\\ncolleague, near you, are you not both already the proscribed and\\npredestined objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off from all hope\\nof royal clemency, what are you, what can you be, while the power of\\nEngland remains, but outlaws?\\n\\n2. If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on, or to give up, the\\nwar? Do we mean to submit, and consent that we shall be ground to powder,\\nand our country and its rights trodden down in the dust? I know we do not\\nmean to submit. We NEVER shall submit! Do we intend to violate that most\\nsolemn obligation ever entered into by men, that plighting, before God, of\\nour sacred honor to Washington, when, putting him forth to incur the\\ndangers of war, as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised\\nto adhere to him in every extremity with our fortunes and our lives? I\\nknow there is not a man here, who would not rather see a general\\nconflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one jot\\nor tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself, having\\ntwelve months ago, in this place, moved you that George Washington be\\nappointed commander of the forces raised, or to be raised, for the defense\\nof American liberty; may my right hand forget her cunning, and my tongue\\ncleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver in the support I\\ngive him.\\n\\n3. The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if the war\\nmust go on, why put off the Declaration of Independence? That measure will\\nstrengthen us. It will give us character abroad. Nations will then treat\\nwith us, which they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects\\nin arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that England herself will\\nsooner treat for peace with us on the footing of independence, than\\nconsent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct\\ntoward us has been a course of injustice and oppression. Her pride will be\\nless wounded by submitting to that course of things, which now\\npredestinates our independence, than by yielding the points in controversy\\nto her rebellious subjects. The former, she would regard as the result of\\nfortune; the latter, she would feel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then,\\ndo we not change this from a civil to a national war? And since we must\\nfight it through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the\\nbenefits of victory, if we gain the victory.\\n\\n4. If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The cause\\nwill raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The people--the\\npeople, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry themselves,\\ngloriously through this struggle. I care not how fickle other people have\\nbeen found. I know the people of these colonies; and I know that\\nresistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their hearts, and\\ncan not be eradicated. Sir, the Declaration of Independence will inspire\\nthe people with increased courage. Instead of a long and bloody war for\\nthe restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances, for chartered\\nimmunities, held under a British king, set before them the glorious object\\nof entire independence, and it will breathe into them anew the spirit of\\nlife.\\n\\n5. Read this declaration at the head of the army; every sword will be\\ndrawn, and the solemn vow uttered to maintain it, or perish on the bed of\\nhonor. Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love\\nof religious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand with it or\\nfall with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it there; let them see\\nit who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill\\nand in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry\\nout in its support.\\n\\n6. Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see--I see clearly\\nthrough this day\\'s business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not\\nlive to see the time this declaration shall be made good. We may die; die\\ncolonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the scaffold.\\nBe it so: be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall\\nrequire the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready at the\\nappointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do live,\\nlet me have a country, or at least the hope of a country, and that a FREE\\ncountry.\\n\\n7. But whatever may be our fate, be assured--be assured that this\\nDeclaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but\\nit will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick\\ngloom of the present I see the brightness of the future as the sun in\\nheaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our\\ngraves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with\\nthanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its\\nannual return they will shed tears,--copious, gushing tears; not of\\nsubjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of\\ngratitude, and of joy.\\n\\n8. Sir, before God I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves the\\nmeasure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am,\\nand all that I hope in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it;\\nand I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for\\nthe Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God,\\nit shall by my dying sentiment; independence now, and INDEPENDENCE\\nFOREVER.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Rec-on-cil-i-a\\'tion, renewal of friendship. Col\\'league\\n(pro. kol\\'leg), an associate in some civil office. Pro-scribed\\', doomed to\\ndestruction, put out of the protection of the law. Pre-des\\'tined, decreed\\nbeforehand. Clem\\'en-cy, mercy, indulgence.\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes.--Mr. Webster, in a speech upon the life and character of John\\nAdams, imagines some one opposed to the Declaration of Independence to\\nhave stated his fears and objections before Congress while deliberating on\\nthat subject. He then supposes Mr. Adams to have replied in the language\\nabove.\\n\\n1. The quotation is from \"Hamlet,\" Act V, Scene 2.\\n\\nYou, sir, who sit in that chair. This was addressed to John Hancock,\\npresident of the Continental Congress. Our venerable colleague refers to\\nSamuel Adams. After the battles of Concord and Lexington, Governor Gage\\noffered pardon to all the rebels who would lay down their arms, excepting\\nSamuel Adams and John Hancock.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXV. THE RISING.\\n\\nThomas Buchanan Read (b. 1822, d. 1872) was born in Chester County,\\nPennsylvania. In 1839 he entered a sculptor\\'s studio in Cincinnati, where\\nhe gained reputation as a portrait painter. He afterwards went to New\\nYork, Boston, and Philadelphia, and, in 1850, to Italy. He divided his\\ntime between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome, in the latter years of\\nhis life. Some or his poems are marked by vigor and strength, while others\\nare distinguished by smoothness and delicacy. The following selection is\\nabridged from \"The Wagoner of the Alleghanies.\"\\n\\n1. Out of the North the wild news came,\\n   Far flashing on its wings of flame,\\n   Swift as the boreal light which flies\\n   At midnight through the startled skies.\\n\\n2. And there was tumult in the air,\\n     The fife\\'s shrill note, the drum\\'s loud beat,\\n   And through the wide land everywhere\\n     The answering tread of hurrying feet,\\n   While the first oath of Freedom\\'s gun\\n   Came on the blast from Lexington.\\n   And Concord, roused, no longer tame,\\n   Forgot her old baptismal name,\\n   Made bare her patriot arm of power,\\n   And swelled the discord of the hour.\\n\\n3. The yeoman and the yoeman\\'s son,\\n     With knitted brows and sturdy dint,\\n   Renewed the polish of each gun,\\n     Recoiled the lock, reset the flint;\\n   And oft the maid and matron there,\\n   While kneeling in the firelight glare,\\n   Long poured, with half-suspended breath,\\n   The lead into the molds of death.\\n\\n4. The hands by Heaven made silken soft\\n     To soothe the brow of love or pain,\\n   Alas! are dulled and soiled too oft\\n     By some unhallowed earthly stain;\\n   But under the celestial bound\\n   No nobler picture can be found\\n   Than woman, brave in word and deed,\\n   Thus serving in her nation\\'s need:\\n   Her love is with her country now,\\n   Her hand is on its aching brow.\\n\\n5. Within its shade of elm and oak\\n     The church of Berkley Manor stood:\\n   There Sunday found the rural folk,\\n     And some esteemed of gentle blood,\\n   In vain their feet with loitering tread\\n     Passed \\'mid the graves where rank is naught:\\n     All could not read the lesson taught\\n   In that republic of the dead.\\n\\n6. The pastor rose: the prayer was strong;\\n   The psalm was warrior David\\'s song;\\n   The text, a few short words of might,--\\n   \"The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!\"\\n\\n7. He spoke of wrongs too long endured,\\n   Of sacred rights to be secured;\\n   Then from his patriot tongue of flame\\n   The startling words for Freedom came.\\n   The stirring sentences he spake\\n   Compelled the heart to glow or quake,\\n   And, rising on his theme\\'s broad wing,\\n     And grasping in his nervous hand\\n     The imaginary battle brand,\\n   In face of death he dared to fling\\n   Defiance to a tyrant king.\\n\\n8. Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed\\n   In eloquence of attitude,\\n   Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;\\n   Then swept his kindling glance of fire\\n   From startled pew to breathless choir;\\n   When suddenly his mantle wide\\n   His hands impatient flung aside,\\n   And, lo! he met their wondering eyes\\n   Complete in all a warrior\\'s guise.\\n\\n9. A moment there was awful pause,--\\n     When Berkley cried, \"Cease, traitor! cease!\\n     God\\'s temple is the house of peace!\"\\n   The other shouted, \"Nay, not so,\\n   When God is with our righteous cause:\\n     His holiest places then are ours,\\n     His temples are our forts and towers\\n   That frown upon the tyrant foe:\\n   In this the dawn of Freedom\\'s day\\n   There is a time to fight and pray!\"\\n\\n10. And now before the open door--\\n      The warrior priest had ordered so--\\n    The enlisting trumpet\\'s sudden soar\\n      Rang through the chapel, o\\'er and o\\'er,\\n    Its long reverberating blow,\\n    So loud and clear, it seemed the ear\\n    Of dusty death must wake and hear.\\n    And there the startling drum and fife\\n    Fired the living with fiercer life;\\n    While overhead with wild increase,\\n    Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,\\n      The great bell swung as ne\\'er before:\\n    It seemed as it would never cease;\\n    And every word its ardor flung\\n    From off its jubilant iron tongue\\n      Was, \"WAR! WAR! WAR!\"\\n\\n11. \"Who dares\"--this was the patriot\\'s cry,\\n      As striding from the desk he came--\\n      \"Come out with me, in Freedom\\'s name,\\n    For her to live, for her to die?\"\\n    A hundred hands flung up reply,\\n    A hundred voices answered \"I!\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Bo\\'re-al, northern. 3. Yeo\\'man, a freeholder, a man\\nfreeborn. Dint, stroke. 5. Man\\'or, a tract of land occupied by tenants.\\nGen\\'tle (pro. jen\\'tl), well born, of good family.  7. Theme, a subject on\\nwhich a person speaks or writes. 8. Guise, external appearance in manner\\nor dress. 10. Soar, a towering flight.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--2. Forgot her ... name. The reference is to the meaning of the\\nword \"concord,\"--harmony, union.\\n\\n4. Celestial bound; i.e., the sky, heaven.\\n\\n6. The pastor. This was John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, who was at this\\ntime a minister at Woodstock, in Virginia. He was a leading spirit among\\nthose opposed to Great Britain, and in 1775 he was elected colonel of a\\nVirginia regiment. The above poem describes his farewell sermon. At its\\nclose he threw off his ministerial gown, and appeared in full regimental\\ndress. Almost every man in the congregation enlisted under him at the\\nchurch door. Muhlenberg became a well-known general in the Revolution, and\\nafter the war served his country in Congress and in various official\\npositions.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXVI. CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.\\n\\nJohn Todd, D.D. (b. 1800, d. 1873), was born in Rutland, Vt. In 1842 he\\nwas settled as a pastor of a Congregational Church, in Pittsfield, Mass,\\nIn 1834, he published \"Lectures to Children\"; in 1835, \"The Student\\'s\\nManual,\" a valuable and popular work, which has been translated into\\nseveral European languages; in 1836, \"The Sabbath-School Teacher\"; and in\\n1841, \"The Lost Sister of Wyoming.\" He was one of the founders of the\\nMount Holyoke Female Seminary.\\n\\n1. No one has a temper naturally so good, that it does not need attention\\nand cultivation, and no one has a temper so bad, but that, by proper\\nculture, it may become pleasant. One of the best disciplined tempers ever\\nseen, was that of a gentleman who was naturally quick, irritable, rash,\\nand violent; but, by having the care of the sick, and especially of\\nderanged people, he so completely mastered himself that he was never known\\nto be thrown off his guard.\\n\\n2. The difference in the happiness which is received or bestowed by the\\nman who governs his temper, and that by the man who does not, is immense.\\nThere is no misery so constant, so distressing, and so intolerable to\\nothers, as that of having a disposition which is your master, and which is\\ncontinually fretting itself. There are corners enough, at every turn in\\nlife, against which we may run, and at which we may break out in\\nimpatience, if we choose.\\n\\n3. Look at Roger Sherman, who rose from a humble occupation to a seat in\\nthe first Congress of the United States, and whose judgment was received\\nwith great deference by that body of distinguished men. He made himself\\nmaster of his temper, and cultivated it as a great business in life. There\\nare one or two instances which show this part of his character in a light\\nthat is beautiful.\\n\\n4. One day, after having received his highest honors, he was sitting and\\nreading in his parlor. A roguish student, in a room close by, held a\\nlooking-glass in such a position as to pour the reflected rays of the sun\\ndirectly in Mr. Sherman\\'s face. He moved his chair, and the thing was\\nrepeated. A third time the chair was moved, but the looking-glass still\\nreflected the sun in his eyes. He laid aside his book, went to the window,\\nand many witnesses of the impudence expected to hear the ungentlemanly\\nstudent severely reprimanded. He raised the window gently, and then--shut\\nthe window blind!\\n\\n5. I can not forbear adducing another instance of the power he had\\nacquired over himself. He was naturally possessed of strong passions; but\\nover these he at length obtained an extraordinary control. He became\\nhabitually calm, sedate, and self-possessed. Mr. Sherman was one of those\\nmen who are not ashamed to maintain the forms of religion in their\\nfamilies. One morning he called them all together, as usual, to lead them\\nin prayer to God; the \"old family Bible\" was brought out, and laid on the\\ntable.\\n\\n6. Mr. Sherman took his seat, and placed beside him one of his children, a\\nchild of his old age; the rest of the family were seated around the room;\\nseveral of these were now grown up. Besides these, some of the tutors of\\nthe college were boarders in the family, and were present at the time\\nalluded to. His aged and superannuated mother occupied a corner of the\\nroom, opposite the place where the distinguished judge sat.\\n\\n7. At length, he opened the Bible, and began to read. The child who was\\nseated beside him made some little disturbance, upon which Mr. Sherman\\npaused and told it to be still. Again he proceeded; but again he paused to\\nreprimand the little offender, whose playful disposition would scarcely\\npermit it to be still. And this time he gently tapped its ear. The blow,\\nif blow it might be called, caught the attention of his aged mother, who\\nnow, with some effort, rose from the seat, and tottered across the room.\\nAt length she reached the chair of Mr. Sherman, and, in a moment, most\\nunexpectedly to him, she gave him a blow on the ear with all the force she\\ncould summon. \"There,\" said she, \"you strike your child, and I will strike\\nmine.\"\\n\\n8. For a moment, the blood was seen mounting to the face of Mr. Sherman;\\nbut it was only for a moment, when all was calm and mild as usual. He\\npaused; he raised his spectacles; he cast his eye upon his mother; again\\nit fell upon the book from which he had been reading. Not a word escaped\\nhim; but again he calmly pursued the service, and soon after sought in\\nprayer an ability to set an example before his household which would be\\nworthy of their imitation. Such a victory was worth more than the proudest\\none ever achieved on the field of battle.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Con-trol\\', subdue, restrain, govern. Cul\\'ture,\\ncultivation, improvement by effort. Dis\\'ci-plined, brought under control,\\ntrained.  2. In-tol\\'er-a-ble, not capable of being borne. 3. Def \\'er-ence,\\nregard, respect. 4. Rep\\'ri-mand-ed, reproved for a fault. 6.\\nSu-per-an\\'nu-a-ted, impaired by old age and infirmity. 8. A-chieved\\',\\ngained.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--Roger Sherman (b. 1721, d. 1793) was born at Newton Massachusetts,\\nand until twenty-two years of age was a shoemaker. He then removed to\\nNew Milford, Connecticut, and was soon afterward appointed surveyor of\\nlands for the county. In 1754, he was admitted to the bar. At various\\ntimes he was elected a judge; sent to the Legislature, to the Colonial\\nAssembly, and to the United States Congress; made a member of the\\ngovernor\\'s council of safety; and, in 1776, a member of the committee\\nappointed to draft the Declaration of Independence, of which he was one of\\nthe signers.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXVII. WILLIAM TELL.\\n\\nJames Sheridan Knowles (b. 1784, d. 1862), a dramatist and actor, was born\\nin Cork, Ireland. In 1792 his father removed to London with his family. At\\nthe age of fourteen, Sheridan wrote an opera called \"The Chevalier de\\nGrillon.\" In 1798 he removed to Dublin, and soon after began his career as\\nan actor and author. In 1835 he visited America. In 1839 an annual pension\\nof 200 Pounds was granted him by the British government. Several years\\nbefore his death he left the stage and became a Baptist minister. The best\\nknown of his plays are \"Caius Gracchus,\" \"Virginius,\" \"Leo, the Gypsy,\"\\n\"The Hunchback,\" and \"William Tell,\" from the last of which the following\\ntwo lessons are abridged.\\n\\nSCENE 1.--A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Gesler, Officers, and Sarnem,\\nwith Tell in chains and guarded.\\n\\nSar. Down, slave! Behold the governor.\\n     Down! down! and beg for mercy.\\n\\nGes. (Seated.) Does he hear?\\n\\nSar. He does, but braves thy power.\\n\\nOfficer. Why don\\'t you smite him for that look?\\n\\nGes. Can I believe\\n     My eyes? He smiles! Nay, grasps\\n     His chains as he would make a weapon of them\\n     To lay the smiter dead. (To Tell.)\\n     Why speakest thou not?\\n\\nTell. For wonder.\\n\\nGes. Wonder?\\n\\nTell. Yes, that thou shouldst seem a man.\\n\\nGes. What should I seem?\\n\\nTell. A monster.\\n\\nGes. Ha! Beware! Think on thy chains.\\n\\nTell. Though they were doubled, and did weigh me down\\n      Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up\\n      Erect, with nothing but the honest pride\\n      Of telling thee, usurper, to thy teeth,\\n      Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains?\\n      How came they on me?\\n\\nGes. Darest thou question me?\\n\\nTell. Darest thou not answer?\\n\\nGes. Do I hear?\\n\\nTell. Thou dost.\\n\\nGes. Beware my vengeance!\\n\\nTell. Can it more than kill?\\n\\nGes. Enough; it can do that.\\n\\nTell. No; not enough:\\n      It can not take away the grace of life;\\n      Its comeliness of look that virtue gives;\\n      Its port erect with consciousness of truth;\\n      Its rich attire of honorable deeds;\\n      Its fair report that\\'s rife on good men\\'s tongues;\\n      It can not lay its hands on these, no more\\n      Than it can pluck the brightness from the sun,\\n      Or with polluted finger tarnish it.\\n\\nGes. But it can make thee writhe.\\n\\nTell. It may.\\n\\nGes. And groan.\\n\\nTell. It may; and I may cry\\n      Go on, though it should make me groan again.\\n\\nGes. Whence comest thou?\\n\\nTell. From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn\\n      What news from thence?\\n\\nGes. Canst tell me any?\\n\\nTell. Ay: they watch no more the avalanche.\\n\\nGes. Why so?\\n\\nTell. Because they look for thee. The hurricane\\n      Comes unawares upon them; from its bed\\n      The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track.\\n\\nGes. What do they then?\\n\\nTell. Thank heaven it is not thou!\\n      Thou hast perverted nature in them.\\n      There\\'s not a blessing heaven vouchsafes them, but\\n      The thought of thee--doth wither to a curse.\\n\\nGes. That\\'s right! I\\'d have them like their hills,\\n     That never smile, though wanton summer tempt\\n     Them e\\'er so much.\\n\\nTell. But they do sometimes smile.\\n\\nGes. Ay! when is that?\\n\\nTell. When they do talk of vengeance.\\n\\nGes. Vengeance? Dare they talk of that?\\n\\nTell. Ay, and expect it too.\\n\\nGes. From whence?\\n\\nTell. From heaven!\\n\\nGes. From heaven?\\n\\nTell. And their true hands\\n      Are lifted up to it on every hill\\n      For justice on thee.\\n\\nGes. Where\\'s thy abode?\\n\\nTell. I told thee, on the mountains.\\n\\nGes. Art married?\\n\\nTell. Yes.\\n\\nGes. And hast a family?\\n\\nTell. A son.\\n\\nGes. A son? Sarnem!\\n\\nSar. My lord, the boy--(Gesler signs to Sarnem to keep\\n        silence, and, whispering, sends him off.)\\n\\nTell. The boy? What boy?\\n      Is \\'t mine? and have they netted my young fledgeling?\\n      Now heaven support me, if they have! He\\'ll own me,\\n      And share his father\\'s ruin! But a look\\n      Would put him on his guard--yet how to give it!\\n      Now heart, thy nerve; forget thou \\'rt flesh, be rock.\\n      They come, they come!\\n      That step--that step--that little step, so light\\n      Upon the ground, how heavy does it fall\\n      Upon my heart! I feel my child! (Enter Sarnem\\n         with Albert, whose eyes are riveted on Tell\\'s bow,\\n         which Sarnem carries.)\\n      \\'T is he! We can but perish.\\n\\nAlb. (Aside.) Yes; I was right. It is my father\\'s bow!\\n     For there\\'s my father! I\\'ll not own him though!\\n\\nSar. See!\\n\\nAlb. What?\\n\\nSar. Look there!\\n\\nAlb. I do, what would you have me see?\\n\\nSar. Thy father.\\n\\nAlb. Who? That--that my father?\\n\\nTell. My boy! my boy! my own brave boy!\\n      He\\'s safe! (Aside.)\\n\\nSar. (Aside to Gesler.) They\\'re like each other.\\n\\nGes. Yet I see no sign\\n     Of recognition to betray the link\\n     Unites a father and his child.\\n\\nSar. My lord,\\n     I am sure it is his father. Look at them.\\n     That boy did spring from him; or never cast\\n     Came from the mold it fitted! It may be\\n     A preconcerted thing \\'gainst such a chance.\\n     That they survey each other coldly thus.\\n\\nGes. We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff.\\n\\nSar. To a dungeon?\\n\\nGes. No; into the court.\\n\\nSar. The court, my lord?\\n\\nGes. And send\\n     To tell the headsman to make ready. Quick!\\n     The slave shall die! You marked the boy?\\n\\nSar. I did. He started; \\'t is his father.\\n\\nGes. We shall see. Away with him!\\n\\nTell. Stop! Stop!\\n\\nGes. What would you?\\n\\nTell. Time,--\\n      A little time to call my thoughts together!\\n\\nGes. Thou shalt not have a minute.\\n\\nTell. Some one, then, to speak with.\\n\\nGes. Hence with him!\\n\\nTell. A moment! Stop!\\n      Let me speak to the boy.\\n\\nGes. Is he thy son?\\n\\nTell. And if\\n      He were, art thou so lost to nature, as\\n      To send me forth to die before his face?\\n\\nGes. Well! speak with him.\\n     Now, Sarnem, mark them well.\\n\\nTell. Thou dost not know me, boy; and well for thee\\n      Thou dost not. I\\'m the father of a son\\n      About thy age. Thou,\\n      I see, wast horn, like him, upon the hills:\\n      If thou shouldst \\'scape thy present thraldom, he\\n      May chance to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee\\n      Relate to him what has been passing here,\\n      And say I laid my hand upon thy head,\\n      And said to thee, if he were here, as thou art,\\n      Thus would I bless him. Mayst thou live, my boy,\\n      To see thy country free, or die for her,\\n      As I do! (Albert weeps.)\\n\\nSar. Mark! he weeps.\\n\\nTell. Were he my son,\\n      He would not shed a tear! He would remember\\n      The cliff where he was bred, and learned to scan\\n      A thousand fathoms\\' depth of nether air;\\n      Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,\\n      And meet the lightning, eye to eye; where last\\n      We spoke together, when I told him death\\n      Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,\\n      Embraced for virtue\\'s sake. He shed a tear!\\n      Now were he by, I\\'d talk to him, and his cheek\\n      Should never blanch, nor moisture dim his eye--\\n      I\\'d talk to him--\\n\\nSar.  He falters!\\n\\nTell. \\'T is too much!\\n      And yet it must be done! I\\'d talk to him--\\n\\nGes. Of what?\\n\\nTell. The mother, tyrant, thou dost make\\n      A widow of! I\\'d talk to him of her.\\n      I\\'d bid him tell her, next to liberty,\\n      Her name was the last word my lips pronounced.\\n      And I would charge him never to forget\\n      To love and cherish her, as he would have\\n      His father\\'s dying blessing rest upon him!\\n\\nSar. You see, as he doth prompt, the other acts.\\n\\nTell. So well he bears it, he doth vanquish me.\\n      My boy! my boy! Oh, for the hills, the hills,\\n      To see him bound along their tops again,\\n      With liberty.\\n\\nSar. Was there not an the father in that look?\\n\\nGes. Yet \\'t is \\'gainst nature.\\n\\nSar. Not if he believes\\n     To own the son would be to make him share\\n     The father\\'s death.\\n\\nGes. I did not think of that! \\'T is well\\n     The boy is not thy son. I\\'ve destined him\\n     To die along with thee.\\n\\nTell. To die? For what?\\n\\nGes. For having braved my power, as thou hast. Lead\\n     them forth.\\nTell. He\\'s but a child.\\n\\nGes. Away with them!\\n\\nTell. Perhaps an only child.\\n\\nGes. No matter.\\n\\nTell. He may have a mother.\\n\\nGes. So the viper hath;\\n     And yet, who spares it for the mother\\'s sake?\\n\\nTell. I talk to stone! I talk to it as though\\n      \\'T were flesh; and know \\'t is none. I\\'ll talk to it\\n      No more. Come, my boy;\\n      I taught thee how to live, I\\'ll show thee how to die.\\n\\nGes. He is thy child?\\n\\nTell. He is my child. (Weeps.)\\n\\nGes. I\\'ve wrung a tear from him! Thy name?\\n\\nTell. My name?\\n      It matters not to keep it from thee now;\\n      My name is Tell.\\n\\nGes. Tell? William Tell?\\n\\nTell. The same.\\n\\nGes. What! he, so famed \\'bove all his countrymen,\\n     For guiding o\\'er the stormy lake the boat?\\n     And such a master of his bow, \\'t is said\\n     His arrows never miss! Indeed! I\\'ll take\\n     Exquisite vengeance! Mark! I\\'ll spare thy life;\\n     Thy boy\\'s too; both of you are free; on one\\n     Condition.\\n\\nTell. Name it.\\n\\nGes. I would see you make\\n     A trial of your skill with that same bow\\n     You shoot so well with.\\n\\nTell. Name the trial you\\n      Would have me make.\\n\\nGes. You look upon your boy\\n     As though instinctively you guessed it.\\n\\nTell. Look upon my boy? What mean you? Look upon\\n      My boy as though I guessed it? Guessed the trial\\n      You\\'d have me make? Guessed it\\n      Instinctively? You do not mean--no--no,\\n      You would not have me make a trial of\\n      My skill upon my child! Impossible!\\n      I do not guess your meaning.\\n\\nGes. I would see\\n     Thee hit an apple at the distance of\\n     A hundred paces.\\n\\nTell. Is my boy to hold it?\\n\\nGes. No.\\n\\nTell. No? I\\'ll send the arrow through the core!\\n\\nGes. It is to rest upon his head.\\n\\nTell. Great heaven, you hear him!\\n\\nGes. Thou dost hear the choice I give:\\n     Such trial of the skill thou art master of,\\n     Or death to both of you, not otherwise\\n     To be escaped.\\n\\nTell. O, monster!\\n\\nGes. Wilt thou do it?\\n\\nAlb. He will! he will!\\n\\nTell. Ferocious monster! Make\\n      A father murder his own child!\\n\\nGes. Take off his chains if he consent.\\n\\nTell. With his own hand!\\n\\nGes. Does he consent?\\n\\nAlb. He does. (Gesler signs to his officers, who proceed to take\\n     off Tell\\'s chains; Tell unconscious what they do.)\\n\\nTell. With his own hand!\\n      Murder his child with his own hand? This hand?\\n      The hand I\\'ve led him, when an infant, by?\\n      \\'T is beyond horror! \\'T is most horrible!\\n      Amazement! (His chains fall off.) What\\'s that you\\'ve\\n           done to me?\\n      Villains! put on my chains again. My hands\\n      Are free from blood, and have no gust for it,\\n      That they should drink my child\\'s! Here! here! I\\'ll\\n      Not murder my boy for Gesler.\\n\\nAlb. Father! Father!\\n     You will not hit me, father!\\n\\nTell. Hit thee? Send\\n      The arrow through thy brain? Or, missing that,\\n      Shoot out an eye? Or, if thine eye escape,\\n      Mangle the cheek I\\'ve seen thy mother\\'s lips\\n      Cover with kisses? Hit thee? Hit a hair\\n      Of thee, and cleave thy mother\\'s heart?\\n\\nGes. Dost thou consent?\\n\\nTell. Give me my bow and quiver.\\n\\nGes. For what?\\n\\nTell. To shoot my boy!\\n\\nAlb. No, father, no!\\n     To save me! You\\'ll be sure to hit the apple.\\n     Will you not save me, father?\\n\\nTell. Lead me forth;\\n      I\\'ll make the trial!\\n\\nAlb. Thank you!\\n\\nTell. Thank me? Do\\n      You know for what? I will not make the trial.\\n      To take him to his mother in my arms!\\n      And lay him down a corse before her!\\n\\nGes. Then he dies this moment, and you certainly\\n     Do murder him whose life you have a chance\\n     To save, and will not use it.\\n\\nTell. Well, I\\'ll do it; I\\'ll make the trial.\\n\\nAlb. Father!\\n\\nTell. Speak not to me:\\n      Let me not hear thy voice: thou must be dumb,\\n      And so should all things be. Earth should be dumb;\\n      And heaven--unless its thunders muttered at\\n      The deed, and sent a bolt to stop! Give me\\n      My bow and quiver!\\n\\nGes. When all\\'s ready.\\n\\nTell. Ready!--\\n      I must be calm with such a mark to hit!\\n      Don\\'t touch me, child!--Don\\'t speak to me!--Lead on!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--Come\\'li-ness, that which is becoming or graceful.

The legend relates that Gesler had his\\ncap placed on a pole in the market place, and all the Swiss were required\\nto salute it in passing in recognition of his authority. Tell refusing to\\ndo this was arrested, and condemned to death. This and the following\\nlesson narrate how the sentence was changed, and the result.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXVIII. WILLIAM TELL. (Concluded.)\\n\\nSCENE 2.--Enter slowly, people in evident distress--Officers, Sarnem,\\nGesler, Tell, Albert, and soldiers--one bearing Tell\\'s bow and\\nquiver--another with a basket of apples.\\n\\nGes. That is your ground. Now shall they measure thence\\n     A hundred paces. Take the distance.\\n\\nTell. Is the line a true one?\\n\\nGes. True or not, what is \\'t to thee?\\n\\nTell. What is \\'t to me? A little thing.\\n      A very little thing; a yard or two\\n      Is nothing here or there--were it a wolf\\n      I shot at! Never mind.\\n\\nGes. Be thankful, slave,\\n     Our grace accords thee life on any terms.\\n\\nTell. I will be thankful, Gesler! Villain, stop!\\n      You measure to the sun.\\n\\nGes. And what of that?\\n     What matter whether to or from the sun?\\n\\nTell. I\\'d have it at my back. The sun should shine\\n      Upon the mark, and not on him that shoots.\\n      I can not see to shoot against the sun:\\n      I will not shoot against the sun!\\n\\nGes. Give him his way! Thou hast cause to bless my mercy.\\n\\nTell. I shall remember it. I\\'d like to see\\n      The apple I\\'m to shoot at.\\n\\nGes. Stay! show me the basket! there!\\n\\nTell. You\\'ve picked the smallest one.\\n\\nGes. I know I have.\\n\\nTell. Oh, do you? But you see\\n      The color of it is dark: I\\'d have it light,\\n      To see it better.\\n\\nGes. Take it as it is;\\n     Thy skill will be the greater if thou hitt\\'st it.\\n     Tell. True! true! I did not think of that; I wonder\\n     I did not think of that. Give me some chance\\n     To save my boy!--\\n     I will not murder him,\\n     If I can help it--for the honor of\\n     The form thou wearest, if all the heart is gone.\\n           (Throws away the apple with all his force.)\\n\\nGes. Well: choose thyself.\\n\\nTell. Have I a friend among the lookers-on?\\n\\nVerner. (Rushing forward.) Here, Tell.\\n\\nTell. I thank thee, Verner!\\n      He is a friend runs out into a storm\\n      To shake a hand with us. I must be brief.\\n      When once the bow is bent, we can not take\\n      The shot too soon. Verner, whatever be\\n      The issue of this hour, the common cause\\n      Must not stand still. Let not to-morrow\\'s sun\\n      Set on the tyrant\\'s banner! Verner! Verner!\\n      The boy! the boy! Thinkest thou he hath the courage\\n      To stand it?\\n\\nVer. Yes.\\n\\nTell. Does he tremble?\\n\\nVer. No.\\n\\nTell. Art sure?\\n\\nVer. I am.\\n\\nTell. How looks he?\\n\\nVer. Clear and smilingly.\\n     If you doubt it, look yourself.\\n\\nTell. No, no, my friend:\\n      To hear it is enough.\\n\\nVer. He bears himself so much above his years--\\n\\nTell. I know! I know!\\n\\nVer. With constancy so modest--\\n\\nTell. I was sure he would--\\n\\nVer. And looks with such relying love\\n     And reverence upon you--\\n\\nTell. Man! Man! Man!\\n      No more! Already I\\'m too much the father\\n      To act the man! Verner, no more, my friend!\\n      I would be flint--flint--flint. Don\\'t make me feel\\n      I\\'m not--do not mind me! Take the boy\\n      And set him, Verner, with his back to me.\\n      Set him upon his knees, and place this apple\\n      Upon his head, so that the stem may front me.\\n      Thus, Verner; charge him to keep steady; tell him\\n      I\\'ll hit the apple! Verner, do all this\\n      More briefly than I tell it thee.\\n\\nVer. Come, Albert! (Leading him out.)\\n\\nAlb. May I not speak with him before I go?\\n\\nVer. No.\\n\\nAlb. I would only kiss his hand.\\n\\nVer. You must not.\\n\\nAlb. I must; I can not go from him without.\\n\\nVer. It is his will you should.\\n\\nAlb. His will, is it?\\n     I am content, then; come.\\n\\nTell. My boy! (Holding out his arms to him.)\\n\\nAlb. My father! (Rushing into Tell\\'s arms.)\\n\\nTell. If thou canst bear it, should not I? Go now,\\n      My son; and keep in mind that I can shoot;\\n      Go, boy; be thou but steady, I will hit\\n      The apple. Go! God bless thee; go. My bow!\\n      (The bow is handed to him.)\\n      Thou wilt not fail thy master, wilt thou? Thou\\n      Hast never failed him yet, old servant. No,\\n      I\\'m sure of thee. I know thy honesty,\\n      Thou art stanch, stanch. Let me see my quiver.\\n\\nGes. Give him a single arrow.\\n\\nTell. Do you shoot?\\n\\nSoldier. I do.\\n\\nTell. Is it so you pick an arrow, friend?\\n      The point, you see, is bent; the feather, jagged.\\n      That\\'s all the use \\'t is fit for. (Breaks it.)\\n\\nGes. Let him have another.\\n\\nTell. Why, \\'t is better than the first,\\n      But yet not good enough for such an aim\\n      As I\\'m to take. \\'T is heavy in the shaft;\\n      I\\'ll not shoot with it! (Throws it away.) Let\\n      me see my quiver.\\n      Bring it! \\'T is not one arrow in a dozen\\n      I\\'d take to shoot with at a dove, much less\\n      A dove like that.\\n\\nGes. It matters not.\\n     Show him the quiver.\\n\\nTell. See if the boy is ready.\\n      (Tell here hides an arrow under his vest.)\\n\\nVer. He is.\\n\\nTell. I \\'m ready too! Keep silent, for\\n      Heaven\\'s sake, and do not stir; and let me have\\n      Your prayers, your prayers, and be my witnesses\\n      That if his life\\'s in peril from my hand,\\n      \\'Tis only for the chance of saving it. (To the people.)\\n\\nGes. Go on.\\n\\nTell. I will.\\n      O friends, for mercy\\'s sake keep motionless\\n      and silent. (Tell shoots. A shout of exultation\\n      bursts from the crowd. Tell\\'s head drops on his\\n      bosom; he with difficulty supports himself on his bow.)\\n\\nVer. (Rushing in with Albert.) The boy is safe, no\\n     hair of him is touched.\\n\\nAlb. Father, I\\'m safe. Your Albert\\'s safe, dear father.\\n     Speak to me! Speak to me!\\n\\nVer. He can not, boy!\\n\\nAlb. You grant him life?\\n\\nGes. I do.\\n\\nAlb. And we are free?\\n\\nGes. You are. (Crossing angrily behind.)\\n\\nAlb. Open his vest,\\n     And give him air. (Albert opens his father\\'s vest,\\n     and the arrow drops. Tell starts, fixes his eyes\\n     on Albert and clasps him to his breast.)\\n\\nTell. My boy! My boy!\\n\\nGes. For what\\n     Hid you that arrow in your breast? Speak, slave!\\n\\nTell. To kill thee, tyrant, had I slain my boy!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--Ac-cords\\', grants, concede. Is\\'sue (pro. ish\\'u), event,\\nconsequence. Stanch, sound, strong.  Jag\\'ged, notched, uneven. Shaft, the\\nstem of an arrow upon which the feather and head are inserted. Quiv\\'er, a\\ncase for arrows.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The legend further relates that on the discovery of the concealed\\narrow Tell was again put in chains. Gesler then embarked for another\\nplace, taking Tell with him. A storm overtook them, and Tell was released\\nto steer the boat. In passing a certain point of land now known as \"Tell\\'s\\nRock\" or \"Leap,\" Tell leaped ashore and escaped: then going to a point\\nwhere he knew the boat must land, he lay concealed until it arrived, when\\nhe shot Gesler through the heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXIX. THE CRAZY ENGINEER.\\n\\n1. My train left Dantzic in the morning generally about eight o\\'clock; but\\nonce a week we had to wait for the arrival of the steamer from Stockholm.\\nIt was the morning of the steamer\\'s arrival that I came down from the\\nhotel, and found that my engineer had been so seriously injured that he\\ncould not perform his work. I went immediately to the engine house to\\nprocure another engineer, for I supposed there were three or four in\\nreserve there, but I was disappointed.\\n\\n2. I heard the puffing of the steamer, and the passengers would be on hand\\nin fifteen minutes. I ran to the guards and asked them if they knew where\\nthere was an engineer, but they did not. I then went to the firemen and\\nasked them if anyone of them felt competent to run the engine to Bromberg.\\nNo one dared to attempt it. The distance was nearly one hundred miles.\\nWhat was to be done?\\n\\n3. The steamer stopped at the wharf, and those who were going on by rail\\ncame flocking to the station. They had eaten breakfast on board the boat,\\nand were all ready for a fresh start. The train was in readiness in the\\nlong station house, and the engine was steaming and puffing away\\nimpatiently in the distant firing house.\\n\\n4. It was past nine o\\'clock. \"Come, why don\\'t we start?\" growled an old,\\nfat Swede, who had been watching me narrowly for the last fifteen minutes.\\nAnd upon this there was a general chorus of anxious inquiry, which soon\\nsettled to downright murmuring. At this juncture some one touched me on\\nthe elbow. I turned, and saw a stranger by my side. I thought that he was\\ngoing to remonstrate with me for my backwardness. In fact, I began to have\\nstrong temptations to pull off my uniform, for every anxious eye was fixed\\nupon the glaring badges which marked me as the chief officer of the train.\\n\\n5. However, this stranger was a middle-aged man, tall and stout, with a\\nface of great energy and intelligence. His eye was black and\\nbrilliant,--so brilliant that I could not gaze steadily into it, though I\\ntried; and his lips, which were very thin, seemed more like polished\\nmarble than human flesh. His dress was black throughout, and not only set\\nwith exact nicety, but was scrupulously clean and neat.\\n\\n6. \"You want an engineer, I understand,\" he said in a low, cautious tone,\\nat the same time gazing quietly about him, as though he wanted no one to\\nhear what he said. \"I do,\" I replied. \"My train is all ready, and we have\\nno engineer within twenty miles of this place.\" \"Well, sir, I am going to\\nBromberg; I must go, and I will run the engine for you.\" \"Ha!\" I uttered,\\n\"are you an engineer?\" \"I am, sir--one of the oldest in the country--and\\nam now on my way to make arrangements for a great improvement I have\\ninvented for the application of steam to a locomotive. My name is Martin\\nKroller. If you wish, I will run as far as Bromberg; and I will show you\\nrunning that is running.\"\\n\\n7. Was I not fortunate? I determined to accept the man\\'s offer at once,\\nand so I told him. He received my answer with a nod and a smile. I went\\nwith him to the house, where we found the engine in charge of the fireman,\\nand all ready for a start. Kroller got upon the platform, and I followed\\nhim. I had never seen a man betray such a peculiar aptness amid machinery\\nas he did. He let on the steam in an instant, but yet with care and\\njudgment, and he backed up to the baggage carriage with the most exact\\nnicety.\\n\\n8. I had seen enough to assure me that he was thoroughly acquainted with\\nthe business, and I felt composed once more. I gave my engine up to the\\nnew man, and then hastened away to the office. Word was passed for all the\\npassengers to take their seats, and soon afterward I waved my hand to the\\nengineer. There was a puff, a groaning of the heavy axletrees, a trembling\\nof the building, and the train was in motion. I leaped upon the platform\\nof the guard carriage, and in a few minutes more the station house was far\\nbehind us.\\n\\n9. In less than an hour we reached Dirschau, where we took up the\\npassengers, that had come on the Konigsberg railway. Here I went forward\\nand asked Kroller how he liked the engine. He replied that he liked it\\nvery much. \"But,\" he added, with a strange sparkling of the eye, \"wait\\nuntil I get my improvement, and then you will see traveling. Why, I could\\nrun an engine of my construction to the moon in four and twenty hours?\"\\n\\n10. I smiled at what I thought his enthusiasm, and then went back to my\\nstation. As soon as the Konigsberg passengers were all on board, and their\\nbaggage carriage attached, we started on again. Soon after, I went into\\nthe guard carriage and sat down. An early train from Konigsberg had been\\nthrough two hours before, and was awaiting us at Little Oscue, where we\\ntook on board the Western mail.\\n\\n11. \"How we go,\" uttered one of the guards, some fifteen minutes after we\\nhad left Dirschau. \"The new engineer is trying the speed,\" I replied, not\\nyet having any fear. But ere long I began to apprehend he was running a\\nlittle too fast. The carriages began to sway to and fro, and I could hear\\nexclamations of fright from the passengers. \"Good heavens!\" cried one of\\nthe guards, coming in at that moment, \"what is that fellow doing? Look,\\nsir, and see how we are going.\"\\n\\n12. I looked at the window, and found that we were dashing along at a\\nspeed never before traveled on that road. Posts, fences, rocks, and trees\\nflew by in one undistinguished mass, and the carriages now swayed\\nfearfully. I started to my feet, and met a passenger on the platform. He\\nwas one of the chief owners of our road, and was just on his way to\\nBerlin. He was pale and excited.\\n\\n13. \"Sir,\" he gasped, \"is Martin Kroller on the engine?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I told him.\\n\\n\"What! didn\\'t you know him?\"\\n\\n\"Know?\" I repeated, somewhat puzzled; \"what do you mean? He told me his\\nname was Kroller, and that he was an engineer. We had no one to run the\\nengine, and--\"\\n\\n\"You took him!\" interrupted the man. \"Good heavens, sir, he is as crazy as\\na man can be! He turned his brain over a new plan for applying steam\\npower. I saw him at the station, but did not fully recognize him, as I was\\nin a hurry. Just now one of your passengers told me that your engineers\\nwere all gone this morning, and that you found one that was a stranger to\\nyou. Then I knew the man whom I had seen was Martin Kroller. He had\\nescaped from the hospital at Stettin. You must get him off somehow.\"\\n\\n14. The whole fearful truth was now open to me. The speed of the train was\\nincreasing every moment, and I knew that a few more miles per hour would\\nlaunch us all into destruction. I called to the guard and then made my way\\nforward as quickly as possible. I reached the back platform of the tender,\\nand there stood Kroller upon the engine board, his hat and coat off, his\\nlong black hair floating wildly in the wind, his shirt unbuttoned at the\\nfront, his sleeves rolled up, with a pistol in his teeth, and thus glaring\\nupon the fireman, who lay motionless upon the fuel. The furnace was\\nstuffed till the very latch of the door was red-hot, and the whole engine\\nwas quivering and swaying as though it would shiver to pieces.\\n\\n15. \"Kroller! Kroller\\'!\" I cried, at the top of my voice. The crazy\\nengineer started, and caught the pistol in his hand. Oh, how those great\\nblack eyes glared, and how ghastly and frightful the face looked!\\n\\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" he yelled demoniacally, glaring upon me like a roused lion.\\n\\n\"They said that I could not make it! But see! see! See my new power! See\\nmy new engine! I made it, and they are jealous of me! I made it, and when\\nit was done, they stole it from me. But I have found it! For years I have\\nbeen wandering in search of my great engine, and they said it was not\\nmade. But I have found it! I knew it this morning when I saw it at\\nDantzic, and I was determined to have it. And I\\'ve got it! Ho! ho! ho!\\nwe\\'re on the way to the moon, I say! We\\'ll be in the moon in four and\\ntwenty hours. Down, down, villain! If you move, I\\'ll shoot you.\"\\n\\nThis was spoken to the poor fireman, who at that moment attempted to rise,\\nand the frightened man sank back again.\\n\\n16. \"Here\\'s Little Oscue just before us,\" cried out one of the guard. But\\neven as he spoke, the buildings were at hand. A sickening sensation\\nsettled upon my heart, for I supposed that we were now gone. The houses\\nflew by like lightning. I knew if the officers here had turned the switch\\nas usual, we should be hurled into eternity in one fearful crash. I saw a\\nflash,--it was another engine,--I closed my eyes; but still we thundered\\non! The officers had seen our speed, and knowing that we would not be able\\nto stop, in that distance, they had changed the switch, so that we went\\nforward.\\n\\n17. But there was sure death ahead, if we did not stop. Only fifteen miles\\nfrom us was the town of Schwetz, on the Vistula; and at the rate we were\\ngoing we should be there in a few minutes, for each minute carried us over\\na mile. The shrieks of the passengers now rose above the crash of the\\nrails, and more terrific than all else arose the demoniac yells of the mad\\nengineer.\\n\\n\"Merciful heavens!\" gasped the guardsman, \"there\\'s not a moment to lose;\\nSchwetz is close. But hold,\" he added; \"let\\'s shoot him.\"\\n\\n18. At that moment a tall, stout German student came over the platform\\nwhere we stood, and saw that the mad-man had his heavy pistol aimed at us.\\nHe grasped a huge stick of wood, and, with a steadiness of nerve which I\\ncould not have commanded, he hurled it with such force and precision that\\nhe knocked the pistol from the maniac\\'s hand. I saw the movement, and on\\nthe instant that the pistol fell, I sprang forward, and the German\\nfollowed me. I grasped the man by the arm; but I should have been nothing\\nin his mad power, had I been alone. He would have hurled me from the\\nplatform, had not the student at that moment struck him upon the head with\\na stick of wood, which he caught as he came over the tender.\\n\\n19. Kroller settled down like a dead man, and on the next instant I shut\\noff the steam and opened the valve. As the free steam shrieked and howled\\nin its escape, the speed began to decrease, and in a few minutes more the\\ndanger was passed. As I settled back, entirely overcome by the wild\\nemotions that had raged within me, we began to turn the river; and before\\nI was fairly recovered, the fireman had stopped the train in the station\\nhouse at Schwetz.\\n\\n20. Martin Kroller, still insensible, was taken from the platform; and, as\\nwe carried him to the guard room, one of the guard recognized him, and\\ntold us that he had been there about two weeks before.\\n\\n\"He came,\" said the guard, \"and swore that an engine which stood near by\\nwas his. He said it was one he had made to go to the moon in, and that it\\nhad been stolen from him. We sent for more help to arrest him, and he\\nfled.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I replied, with a shudder, \"I wish he had approached me in the\\nsame way; but he was more cautious at Dantzic.\"\\n\\nAt Schwartz we found an engineer to run the engine to Bromberg; and having\\ntaken out the western mail for the next northern mail to carry along, we\\nsaw that Kroller would be properly attended to, and then started on.\\n\\n21. The rest of the trip we ran in safety, though I could see the\\npassengers were not wholly at ease, and would not be until they were\\nentirely clear of the railway. Martin Kroller remained insensible from the\\neffects of the blow nearly two weeks; and when he recovered from that, he\\nwas sound again; his insanity was all gone. I saw him about three weeks\\nafterward, but he had no recollection of me. He remembered nothing of the\\npast year, not even his mad freak on my engine. But I remembered it, and I\\nremember it still; and the people need never fear that I shall be imposed\\nupon again by a crazy engineer.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Com\\'pe-tent, fit, qualified. 4.

THE HERITAGE.\\n\\nJames Russell Lowell (b. 1819, d.1891) was born in Cambridge, Mass., and\\nwas graduated from Harvard College. He entered the profession of law; but,\\nin 1843, turned aside to publish \"The Pioneer, a Literary and Critical\\nMagazine.\" In 1855 he was appointed professor of Belles-lettres in Harvard\\nCollege. From 1877 to 1885 he was U.S. Minister, first to Spain,\\nafterwards to Great Britain. Lowell\\'s powers as a writer were very\\nversatile, and his poems range from the most dreamy and imaginative to the\\nmost trenchant and witty. Among his most noted poetical works are \"The\\nBiglow Papers,\" \"A Fable for Critics,\" \"The Vision of Sir Launfal,\" \"The\\nCathedral,\" and \"The Legend of Brittany;\" while \"Conversations on some of\\nthe Old Poets,\" \"Among my Books,\" and \"My Study Windows,\" place him in the\\nfront rank as an essayist.\\n\\n1.

He was\\nadmitted to the bar in 1799, and afterwards practiced law, with eminent\\nsuccess, at Richmond and Norfolk, Va. He was one of the counsel for the\\nprosecution in the trial of Aaron Burr for treason. From 1817 to 1829 he\\nwas attorney-general for the United States. In 1803 he published the\\n\"Letters of a British Spy,\" a work which attracted much attention, and in\\n1817 a \"Life of Patrick Henry.\"\\n\\n1. The education, moral and intellectual, of every individual, must be\\nchiefly his own work. Rely upon it that the ancients were right; both in\\nmorals and intellect we give the final shape to our characters, and thus\\nbecome, emphatically, the architects of our own fortune. How else could it\\nhappen that young men, who have had precisely the same opportunities,\\nshould be continually presenting us with such different results, and\\nrushing to such opposite destinies?\\n\\n2. Difference of talent will not solve it, because that difference is very\\noften in favor of the disappointed candidate. You will see issuing from\\nthe walls of the same college, nay, sometimes from the bosom of the same\\nfamily, two young men, of whom one will be admitted to be a genius of high\\norder, the other scarcely above the point of mediocrity; yet you will see\\nthe genius sinking and perishing in poverty, obscurity, and wretchedness;\\nwhile, on the other hand, you will observe the mediocre plodding his slow\\nbut sure way up the hill of life, gaining steadfast footing at every step,\\nand mounting, at length, to eminence and distinction, an ornament to his\\nfamily, a blessing to his country.\\n\\n3. Now, whose work is this? Manifestly their own. They are the\\narchitects of their respective fortunes. The best seminary of\\nlearning that can open its portals to you can do no more than to\\nafford you the opportunity of instruction; but it must depend, at\\nlast, on yourselves, whether you will be instructed or not, or to\\nwhat point you will push your instruction.\\n\\n4. And of this be assured, I speak from observation a certain truth: THERE\\nIS NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT GREAT LABOR. It is the fiat of fate, from which\\nno power of genius can absolve you.\\n\\n5. Genius, unexerted, is like the poor moth that flutters around a candle\\ntill it scorches itself to death. If genius be desirable at all, it is\\nonly of that great and magnanimous kind, which, like the condor of South\\nAmerica, pitches from the summit of Chimborazo, above the clouds, and\\nsustains itself at pleasure in that empyreal region with an energy rather\\ninvigorated than weakened by the effort.\\n\\n6. It is this capacity for high and long-continued exertion, this vigorous\\npower of profound and searching investigation, this careering and\\nwide-spreading comprehension of mind, and these long reaches of thought,\\nthat\\n\\n   \"Pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,\\n   Or dive into the bottom of the deep,\\n   And pluck up drowned honor by the locks;\"\\n\\nthis is the prowess, and these the hardy achievements, which are to enroll\\nyour names among the great men of the earth.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

Oh! the old, old clock of the household stock,\\n     Was the brightest thing, and neatest;\\n   Its hands, though old, had a touch of gold,\\n     And its chimes rang still the sweetest;\\n   \\'T was a monitor, too, though its words were few,\\n     Yet they lived, though nations altered;\\n   And its voice, still strong, warned old and young,\\n     When the voice of friendship faltered:\\n   \"Tick! tick!\" it said, \"quick, quick, to bed:\\n     For ten I\\'ve given warning;\\n   Up! up! and go, or else you know,\\n     You\\'ll never rise soon in the morning!\"\\n\\n2. A friendly voice was that old, old clock,\\n     As it stood in the corner smiling,\\n   And blessed the time with merry chime,\\n     The wintry hours beguiling;\\n   But a cross old voice was that tiresome clock,\\n     As it called at daybreak boldly;\\n   When the dawn looked gray o\\'er the misty way,\\n     And the early air looked coldly:\\n   \"Tick! tick!\" it said, \"quick out of bed:\\n     For five I\\'ve given warning;\\n   You\\'ll never have health, you\\'ll never have wealth,\\n     Unless you\\'re up soon in the morning!\"\\n\\n3. Still hourly the sound goes round and round,\\n     With a tone that ceases never:\\n   While tears are shed for bright days fled,\\n     And the old friends lost forever!\\n   Its heart beats on, though hearts are gone\\n     That beat like ours, though stronger;\\n   Its hands still move, though hands we love\\n     Are clasped on earth no longer!\\n   \"Tick! tick!\" it said, \"to the churchyard bed,\\n     The grave hath given warning;\\n   Up! up! and rise, and look at the skies,\\n     And prepare for a heavenly morning!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXIII. THE EXAMINATION\\n\\nDaniel Pierce Thompson (b. 1193, d. 1868) was born at Charlestown, Mass.,\\nbut soon removed with his father to Vermont, where he lived until twenty\\nyears of age, on a farm. His means of schooling were most limited, but he\\nwas very ambitious and seized every opportunity. By his own efforts he\\nearned enough money to carry him through Middlebury College, where he\\ngraduated in 1820. He then went to Virginia as private tutor, and while\\nthere was entered at the bar. He shortly returned to Vermont, and opened a\\nlaw office in Montpelier. In time he was elected a judge, and later\\nsecretary of state. From his college days Mr. Thompson was a writer for\\nthe various magazines. Among his novels may be mentioned \"Locke Amsden,\\nthe Schoolmaster,\" \"May Martin, or the Money Diggers,\" \"The Green Mountain\\nBoys,\" and \"The Rangers, or the Tory\\'s Daughter.\"\\n\\n1. \"Have you any questions to ask me in the other branches, sir?\" asked\\nLocke.\\n\\n\"Not many,\" replied Bunker. \"There is reading, writing, grammar, etc.,\\nwhich I know nothing about; and as to them, I must, of course, take you by\\nguess, which will not be much of a guess, after all, if I find you have\\nthought well on all other matters. Do you understand philosophy?\"\\n\\n2. \"To what branch of philosophy do you allude, sir?\"\\n\\n\"To the only branch there is.\"\\n\\n\"But you are aware that philosophy is divided into different kinds; as,\\nnatural, moral, and intellectual.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! philosophy is philosophy, and means the study of the reasons\\nand causes of the things which we see, whether it be applied to a crazy\\nman\\'s dreams, or the roasting of potatoes. Have you attended to it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to a considerable extent, sir.\"\\n\\n3. \"I will put a question or two, then, if you please. What is the reason\\nof the fact, for it is a fact, that the damp breath of a person blown on a\\ngood knife and on a bad one, will soonest disappear from the well-tempered\\nblade?\"\\n\\n\"It may be owing to the difference in the polish of the two blades,\\nperhaps.\" replied Locke.\\n\\n4. \"Ah! that is an answer that don\\'t go deeper than the surface,\" rejoined\\nBunker, humorously. \"As good a thinker as you evidently are, you have not\\nthought on this subject, I suspect. It took me a week, in all, I presume,\\nof hard thinking, and making experiments at a blacksmith\\'s shop, to\\ndiscover the reason of this. It is not the polish; for take two blades of\\nequal polish, and the breath will disappear from one as much quicker than\\nit does from the other, as the blade is better. It is because the material\\nof the blade is more compact or less porous in one case than in the other.\\n\\n\\n5. \"In the first place, I ascertained that the steel was, made more\\ncompact by being hammered and tempered, and that the better it was\\ntempered the more compact it would become; the size of the pores being\\nmade, of course, less in the same proportion. Well, then, I saw the reason\\nI was in search of, at once. For we know a wet sponge is longer in drying\\nthan a wet piece of green wood, because the pores of the first are bigger.\\nA seasoned or shrunk piece of wood dries quicker than a green one, for the\\nsame reason.\\n\\n6. \"Or you might bore a piece of wood with large gimlet holes, and another\\nwith small ones, fill them both with water, and let them stand till the\\nwater evaporated, and the difference of time it would take to do this\\nwould make the case still more plain. So with the blades: the vapor\\nlingers longest on the worst wrought and tempered one, because the pores,\\nbeing larger, take in more of the wet particles, and require more time in\\ndrying.\"\\n\\n7. \"Your theory is at least a very ingenious one,\" observed Locke, \"and I\\nam reminded by it of another of the natural phenomena, of the true\\nexplanation of which I have not been able to satisfy myself. It is this:\\nwhat makes the earth freeze harder and deeper under a trodden path than\\nthe untrodden earth around it? All that I have asked, say it is because\\nthe trodden earth is more compact. But is that reason a sufficient one?\"\\n\\n8. \"No,\" said Bunker, \"but I will tell you what the reason is, for I\\nthought that out long ago. You know that, in the freezing months, much of\\nthe warmth we get is given out by the earth, from which, at intervals, if\\nnot constantly, to some extent, ascend the warm vapors to mingle with and\\nmoderate the cold atmosphere above.\\n\\n9. \"Now these ascending streams of warm air would be almost wholly\\nobstructed by the compactness of a trodden path, and they would naturally\\ndivide at some distance below it, and pass up through the loose earth on\\neach side, leaving the ground along the line of the path, to a great depth\\nbeneath it, a cold, dead mass, through which the frost would continue to\\npenetrate, unchecked by the internal heat, which, in its unobstructed\\nascent on each side, would be continually checking or overcoming the frost\\nin its action on the earth around.\\n\\n10. \"That, sir, is the true philosophy of the case, you may depend upon\\nit. But we will now drop the discussion of these matters; for I am\\nabundantly satisfied that you have not only knowledge enough, but that you\\ncan think for yourself. And now, sir, all I wish to know further about you\\nis, whether you can teach others to think, which is half the battle with a\\nteacher. But as I have had an eye on this point, while attending to the\\nothers, probably one experiment, which I will ask you to make on one of\\nthe boys here, will be all I shall want.\"\\n\\n\"Proceed, sir,\" said the other.\\n\\n11. \"Ay, sir,\" rejoined Bunker, turning to the open fireplace, in which\\nthe burning wood was sending up a column of smoke, \"there, you see that\\nsmoke rising, don\\'t you? Well, you and I know the, reason why smoke goes\\nupward, but my youngest boy does not, I think. Now take your own way, and\\nsee if you can make him understand it.\"\\n\\n12. Locke, after a moment\\'s reflection, and a glance round the room for\\nsomething to serve for apparatus, took from a shelf, where he had espied a\\nnumber of articles, the smallest of a set of cast-iron cart boxes, as are\\nusually termed the round hollow tubes in which the axletree of a carriage\\nturns. Then selecting a tin cup that would just take in the box, and\\nturning into the cup as much water as he judged, with the box, would fill\\nit, he presented them separately to the boy, and said,\\n\\n\"There, my lad, tell me which of these is the heavier.\"\\n\\n13. \"Why, the cart box, to be sure,\" replied the boy, taking the cup,\\nhalf-filled with water, in one hand, and the hollow iron in the other.\\n\\n\"Then you think this iron is heavier than as much water as would fill the\\nplace of it, do you?\" resumed Locke.\\n\\n\"Why, yes, as heavy again, and more too--I know it is,\" promptly said the\\nboy.\\n\\n14. \"Well, sir, now mark what I do,\" proceeded the former, dropping into\\nthe cup the iron box, through the hollow of which the water instantly rose\\nto the brim of the vessel.\\n\\n\"There, you saw that water rise to the top of the cup, did you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I did.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, what caused it to do so?\"\\n\\n15. \"Why, I know well enough, if I could only think: why, it is because\\nthe iron is the heavier, and as it comes all around the water so it can\\'t\\nget away sideways, it is forced up.\"\\n\\n\"That is right; and now I want you to tell what makes that smoke rise up\\nthe chimney.\"\\n\\n16. \"Why,--I guess,\" replied the boy, hesitating, \"I guess,--I guess I\\ndon\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Did you ever get up in a chair to look on some high shelf, so that your\\nhead was brought near the ceiling of a heated room, in winter? and did you\\nnotice any difference between the air up there and the air near the\\nfloor?\"\\n\\n17. \"Yes, I remember I have, and found the air up there as warm as\\nmustard; and when I got down, and bent my head near the floor to pick up\\nsomething, I found it as cold as could be.\"\\n\\n\"That is ever the case; but I wish you to tell me how the cold air always\\nhappens to settle down to the lower part of the room, while the warm air,\\nsomehow, at the same time, gets above.\"\\n\\n18. \"Why, why, heavy things settle down, and the cold air--yes, yes,\\nthat\\'s it, I am sure--the cold air is heavier, and so settles down, and\\ncrowds up the warm air.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. You then understand that cold air is heavier than the heated\\nair, as that iron is heavier than the water; so now we will go back to the\\nmain question--what makes the smoke go upwards?\"\\n\\n19. \"Oh! I see now as plain as day; the cold air settles down all round,\\nlike the iron box, and drives up the hot air as fast as the fire heats it,\\nin the middle, like the water; and so the hot air carries the smoke along\\nup with it, just as feathers and things in a whirlwind. Well! I have found\\nout what makes smoke go up--is n\\'t it curious?\"\\n\\n20. \"Done like a philosopher!\" cried Bunker. \"The thing is settled. I will\\ngrant that you are a teacher among a thousand. You can not only think\\nyourself, but can teach others to think; so you may call the position\\nyours as quick as you please.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. In-tel-lec\\'tu-al, treating of the mind. 3.

In\\n1845 he published \"Attractions of Language.\" For many years he was\\nliterary editor of the \"Chicago Journal.\" Mr. Taylor wrote considerably\\nfor the magazines, was the author of many well-known favorite pieces both\\nin prose and verse, and achieved success as a lecturer.\\n\\n1. Oh, a wonderful stream is the river of Time,\\n     As it runs through the realm of tears,\\n   With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme,\\n   And a boundless sweep and a surge sublime,\\n     As it blends with the ocean of Years.\\n\\n2. How the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow,\\n     And the summers, like buds between;\\n   And the year in the sheaf--so they come and they go,\\n   On the river\\'s breast, with its ebb and flow,\\n     As it glides in the shadow and sheen.\\n\\n3. There\\'s a magical isle up the river of Time,\\n     Where the softest of airs are playing;\\n   There\\'s a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,\\n   And a song as sweet as a vesper chime,\\n     And the Junes with the roses are staying.\\n\\n4.

He was an\\nambitious student, and graduated at Harvard College before he was eighteen\\nyears of age. He then traveled in Europe, spending some time at the German\\nuniversities. On his return, in 1822, he was appointed tutor in Greek at\\nHarvard. His writings at this time were a small volume of original poems,\\nsome translations from Schiller and Goethe, and a few striking essays. Mr.\\nBancroft has held numerous high political offices. In 1838 he was\\nappointed collector of the port at Boston; in 1845 he was made secretary\\nof the Navy; in 1849 he was sent as United States Minister to Great\\nBritain; and in 1867 he was sent in the same capacity to Prussia. The work\\nwhich has given Mr. Bancroft his great literary reputation is his \"History\\nof the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent.\" The\\nfirst volume appeared in 1834. Philosophical in reasoning, interesting,\\nterse in style, and founded on careful research, under the most favorable\\nadvantages, the work stands alone in its sphere.\\n\\n1. The evening of the fifth came on. The young moon was shining brightly\\nin a cloudless winter sky, and its light was increased by a new-fallen\\nsnow. Parties of soldiers were driving about the streets, making a parade\\nof valor, challenging resistance, and striking the inhabitants\\nindiscriminately with sticks or sheathed cutlasses.\\n\\n2. A band, which poured out from Murray\\'s barracks, in Brattle Street,\\narmed with clubs, cutlasses, and bayonets, provoked resistance, and a fray\\nensued. Ensign Maul, at the gate of the barrack yard, cried to the\\nsoldiers: \"Turn out, and I will stand by you; kill them; stick them; knock\\nthem down; run your bayonets through them.\" One soldier after another\\nleveled a firelock, and threatened to \"make a lane\" through the crowd.\\n\\n3. Just before nine, as an officer crossed King Street, now State Street,\\na barber\\'s lad cried after him: \"There goes a mean fellow who hath not\\npaid my father for dressing his hair;\" on which, the sentinel stationed at\\nthe westerly end of the customhouse, on the corner of King Street and\\nExchange Lane, left his post, and with his musket gave the boy a stroke on\\nthe head, that made him stagger and cry for pain.\\n\\n4. The street soon became clear, and nobody troubled the sentry, when a\\nparty of soldiers issued violently from the main guard, their arms\\nglittering in the moonlight, and passed on, hallooing: \"Where are they?\\nwhere are they? Let them come.\"\\n\\n5. Presently twelve or fifteen more, uttering the same cries, rushed from\\nthe south into King Street, and so by the way of Cornhill towards Murray\\'s\\nbarracks. \"Pray, soldiers, spare my life,\" cried a boy of twelve, whom\\nthey met. \"No, no, I\\'ll kill you all,\" answered one of them, and knocked\\nhim down with his cutlass. They abused and insulted several persons at\\ntheir doors and others in the street; \"running about like madmen in a\\nfury,\" crying, \"Fire!\" which seemed their watchword, and, \"Where are\\nthey? Knock them down.\" Their outrageous behavior occasioned the ringing\\nof the bell at the head of King Street.\\n\\n6. The citizens, whom the alarm set in motion, came out with canes and\\nclubs; and, partly by the interference of well-disposed officers, partly\\nby the courage of Crispus Attucks, a mulatto, and some others, the fray at\\nthe barracks was soon over. Of the citizens, the prudent shouted, \"Home!\\nhome!\" others, it is said, cried out, \"Huzza for the main guard! there is\\nthe nest;\" but the main guard was not molested the whole evening.\\n\\n7. A body of soldiers came up Royal Exchange Lane, crying, \"Where are the\\ncowards?\" and, brandishing their arms, passed through King Street. From\\nten to twenty boys came after them, asking, \"Where are they? where are\\nthey?\" \"There is the soldier who knocked me down,\" said the barber\\'s boy;\\nand they began pushing one another towards the sentinel. He loaded and\\nprimed his musket. \"The lobster is going to fire,\" cried a boy. Waving his\\npiece about, the sentinel pulled the trigger.\\n\\n8. \"If you fire you must die for it,\" said Henry Knox, who was passing by.\\n\"I don\\'t care,\" replied the sentry, \"if they touch me, I\\'ll fire.\" \"Fire!\"\\nshouted the boys, for they were persuaded he could not do it without leave\\nfrom a civil officer; and a young fellow spoke out, \"We will knock him\\ndown for snapping,\" while they whistled through their fingers and huzzaed.\\n\"Stand off !\" said the sentry, and shouted aloud, \"Turn out, main guard!\"\\n\"They are killing the sentinel,\" reported a servant from the customhouse,\\nrunning to the main guard. \"Turn out! why don\\'t you turn cut?\" cried\\nPreston, who was captain of the day, to the guard.\\n\\n9. A party of six, two of whom, Kilroi and Montgomery, had been worsted at\\nthe ropewalk, formed, with a corporal in front and Preston following. With\\nbayonets fixed, they \"rushed through the people\" upon the trot, cursing\\nthem, and pushing them as they went along. They found about ten persons\\nround the sentry, while about fifty or sixty came down with them. \"For\\nGod\\'s sake,\" said Knox! holding Preston by the coat, \"take your men back\\nagain; if they fire, your life must answer for the consequences.\" \"I know\\nwhat I am about,\" said he hastily, and much agitated.\\n\\n10. None pressed on them or provoked them till they began loading, when a\\nparty of about twelve in number, with sticks in their hands, moved from\\nthe middle of the street where they had been standing, gave three cheers,\\nand passed along the front of the soldiers, whose muskets some of them\\nstruck as they went by. \"You are cowardly rascals,\" they said, \"for\\nbringing arms against naked men.\" \"Lay aside your guns, and we are ready\\nfor you.\" \"Are the soldiers loaded?\" inquired Palmes of Preston. \"Yes,\" he\\nanswered, \"with powder and ball.\" \"Are they going to fire upon the\\ninhabitants?\" asked Theodore Bliss. \"They can not, without my orders,\"\\nreplied Preston; while \"the town-born\" called out, \"Come on, you rascals,\\nyou bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, fire, if you dare. We know you\\ndare not.\"\\n\\n11. Just then, Montgomery received a blow from a stick which had hit his\\nMusket; and the word \"fire!\" being given by Preston, he stepped a little\\nto one side, and shot Attucks, who at the time was quietly leaning on a\\nlong stick. \"Don\\'t fire!\" said Langford, the watchman, to Kilroi, looking\\nhim full in the face; but yet he did so, and Samuel Gray, who was standing\\nnext Langford, fell lifeless. The rest fired slowly and in succession on\\nthe people, who were dispersing. Three persons were killed, among them\\nAttucks, the mulatto; eight were wounded, two of them mortally. Of all the\\neleven, not more than one had any share in the disturbance.\\n\\n12. So infuriated were the soldiers that, when the men returned to take up\\nthe dead, they prepared to fire again, but were checked by Preston, while\\nthe Twenty-ninth Regiment appeared under arms in King Street. \"This is our\\ntime,\" cried the soldiers of the Fourteenth; and dogs were never seen more\\ngreedy for their prey.\\n\\n13. The bells rung in all the churches; the town drums beat. \"To arms! to\\narms!\" was the cry. \"Our hearts,\" said Warren, \"beat to arms, almost\\nresolved by one stroke to avenge the death of our slaughtered brethren;\"\\nbut they stood self-possessed, demanding justice according to the law.\\n\"Did you not know that you should not have fired without the order of a\\ncivil magistrate?\" asked Hutchinson, on meeting Preston. \"I did it,\"\\nanswered Preston, \"to save my men.\"\\n\\n14. The people would not be pacified or retire till the regiment was\\nconfined to the guardroom and the barracks; and Hutchinson himself gave\\nassurances that instant inquiries should be made by the county\\nmagistrates. One hundred persons remained to keep watch on the\\nexamination, which lasted till three hours after midnight. A warrant was\\nissued against Preston, who surrendered himself to the sheriff; and the\\nsoldiers of his party were delivered up and committed to prison.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. In-dis-crim\\'i-nate-ly, without distinction. 2. En-sued\\',\\nfollowed, resulted from. En\\'sign (pro. en\\'sin). an officer of low rank.\\nFire\\'lock, an old-style musket, with flintlock. 7.

SQUEERS\\'S METHOD.\\n\\nCharles Dickens (b. 1812, d. 1870). This celebrated novelist was born in\\nPortsmouth, England. He began his active life as a lawyer\\'s apprentice, in\\nLondon; but soon became a reporter, and followed this occupation from 1831\\nto 1836. His first book was entitled \"Sketches of London Society, by Boz.\"\\nIn 1837 he published the \"Pickwick Papers,\" a work which established his\\nreputation as a writer. His other works followed with great rapidity, and\\nhis last, \"Edwin Drood,\" was unfinished when he died. He visited America\\nin 1842 and in 1867. He is buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens\\nexcelled in humor and pathos, and was particularly successful in\\ndelineating the joys and griefs of childhood. His writings have a tendency\\nto prompt to deeds of kindness and benevolence. The following extract is\\ntaken from \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" one of the best of his novels.\\n\\n1. \"Come,\" said Squeers, \"let\\'s go to the schoolroom; and lend me a hand\\nwith my school coat, will you?\"\\n\\nNicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian shooting jacket,\\nwhich he took down from a peg in the passage; and Squeers, arming himself\\nwith his cane, led the way across a yard to a door in the rear of the\\nhouse.\\n\\n\"There,\" said the schoolmaster, as they stepped in together; \"this is our\\nshop, Nickleby.\"\\n\\n2. It was such a crowded scene, and there were so many objects to attract\\nattention, that at first Nicholas stared about him, really without seeing\\nanything at all. By degrees, however, the place resolved itself into a\\nbare and dirty room with a couple of windows, whereof a tenth part might\\nbe of glass, the remainder being stopped up with old copy books and paper.\\n\\n\\n3. There were a couple of long, old, rickety desks, cut and notched, and\\ninked and damaged in every possible way; two or three forms, a detached\\ndesk for Squeers, and another for his assistant. The ceiling was supported\\nlike that of a barn, by crossbeams and rafters, and the walls were so\\nstained and discolored that it was impossible to tell whether they had\\never been touched by paint or whitewash.\\n\\n4. Pale and haggard faces, lank and bony figures, children with the\\ncountenances of old men, deformities with irons upon their limbs, boys of\\nstunted growth, and others whose long, meager legs would hardly bear their\\nstooping bodies, all crowded on the view together. There were little faces\\nwhich should have been handsome, darkened with the scowl of sullen, dogged\\nsuffering; there was childhood with the light of its eye quenched, its\\nbeauty gone, and its helplessness alone remaining.\\n\\n5. And yet this scene, painful as it was, had its grotesque features,\\nwhich, in a less interested observer than Nicholas, might have provoked a\\nsmile. Mrs. Squeers stood at one of the desks, presiding over an immense\\nbasin of brimstone and treacle, of which delicious compound she\\nadministered a large installment to each boy in succession, using for the\\npurpose a common wooden spoon, which might have been originally\\nmanufactured for some gigantic top, and which widened every young\\ngentleman\\'s mouth considerably, they being all obliged, under heavy\\ncorporeal penalties, to take in the whole bowl at a gasp.\\n\\n6. \"Now,\" said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane, which\\nmade half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots, \"is that\\nphysicking over?\"\\n\\n\"Just over,\" said Mrs. Squeers, choking the last boy in her hurry, and\\ntapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him. \"Here,\\nyou Smike: take away now. Look sharp!\"\\n\\n7. Smike shuffled out with the basin, and Mrs. Squeers hurried out after\\nhim into a species of washhouse, where there was a small fire, and a large\\nkettle, together with a number of little wooden bowls which were arranged\\nupon a board. Into these bowls Mrs. Squeers, assisted by the hungry\\nservant, poured a brown composition which looked like diluted pincushions\\nwithout the covers, and was called porridge. A minute wedge of brown bread\\nwas inserted in each bowl, and when they had eaten their porridge by means\\nof the bread, the boys ate the bread itself, and had finished their\\nbreakfast, whereupon Mr. Squeers went away to his own.\\n\\n8. After some half-hour\\'s delay Mr. Squeers reappeared, and the boys took\\ntheir places and their books, of which latter commodity the average might\\nbe about one to eight learners. A few minutes having elapsed, during which\\nMr. Squeers looked very profound, as if he had a perfect apprehension of\\nwhat was inside all the books, and could say every word of their contents\\nby heart, if he only chose to take the trouble, that gentleman called up\\nthe first class.\\n\\n9. Obedient to this summons there ranged themselves in front of the\\nschoolmaster\\'s desk, half a dozen scarecrows, out at knees and elbows, one\\nof whom placed a torn and filthy book beneath his learned eye.\\n\\n\"This is the first class in English spelling and philosophy, Nickleby,\"\\nsaid Squeers, beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him. \"We\\'ll get up a\\nLatin one, and hand that over to you. Now, then, where\\'s the first boy?\"\\n\\n10. \"Please, sir, he\\'s cleaning the back parlor window,\" said the\\ntemporary head of the philosophical class.\\n\\n\"So he is, to be sure,\" rejoined Squeers. \"We go upon the practical mode\\nof teaching, Nickleby; the regular education system. C-l-e-a-n, clean,\\nverb active, to make bright, to scour. W-i-n, win, d-e-r, der, winder, a\\ncasement. When the boy knows this out of book, he goes and does it. It\\'s\\njust the same principle as the use of the globes. Where\\'s the second boy?\"\\n\\n\\n11. \"Please, sir, he is weeding the garden,\" replied a small voice.\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said Squeers, by no means disconcerted, \"so he is. B-o-t,\\nbot, t-i-n, tin, n-e-y, ney, bottinney, noun substantive, a knowledge of\\nplants. When he has learned that bottinney means a knowledge of plants,\\nhe goes and knows \\'em. That\\'s our system, Nickleby: what do you think of\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very useful one, at any rate,\" answered Nicholas, significantly.\\n\\n12. \"I believe you,\" rejoined Squeers, not remarking the emphasis of his\\nusher. \"Third boy, what\\'s a horse?\"\\n\\n\"A beast, sir,\" replied the boy.\\n\\n\"So it is,\" said Squeers. \"Ain\\'t it, Nickleby?\"\\n\\n\"I believe there is no doubt of that, sir,\" answered Nicholas.\\n\\n\"Of course there is n\\'t,\" said Squeers. \"A horse is a quadruped, and\\nquadruped\\'s Latin for beast, as everybody that\\'s gone through the grammar\\nknows, or else where\\'s the use of having grammars at all?\"\\n\\n\"Where, indeed!\" said Nicholas, abstractedly.\\n\\n13. \"As you\\'re perfect in that,\" resumed Squeers, turning to the boy, \"go\\nand look after my horse, and rub him down well, or I\\'ll rub you down. The\\nrest of the class go and draw water up till somebody tells you to leave\\noff, for it\\'s washing day to-morrow, and they want the coppers filled.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

Sig-nif \\'i-cant-ly, with\\nmeaning. 12. Ab-stract\\'-ed-ly, in an absent-minded way.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--1. Mr. Squeers is represented as an ignorant, brutal teacher, many\\nof whom were to be found in Yorkshire, England, at the time of this story.\\n\\n\\nNicholas Nickleby is a well-educated, refined young man, who has just\\nobtained the position of assistant teacher, not knowing Squeers\\'s true\\ncharacter.\\n\\n6. Smike is a poor scholar, disowned by his parents, and made almost\\nidiotic by harsh treatment.\\n\\nThe novel from which this story is abridged, aided greatly in a\\nmuch-needed reform in the Yorkshire schools; and the character of Squeers\\nwas so true to life, that numerous suits were threatened against Mr.\\nDickens by those who thought themselves caricatured.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXIX. THE GIFT OF EMPTY HANDS.\\n\\nMrs. S. M. B. Piatt (b, 1835,--) was born near Lexington, Ky. While still\\na young girl she began to write poetry, which was well received. In 1861\\nshe was married to the poet John James Piatt. Mrs. Piatt\\'s poetry is\\nmarked by tender pathos, thoughtfulness, and musical flow of rhythm. The\\nfollowing selection is from \"That New World.\"\\n\\n1. They were two princes doomed to death;\\n   Each loved his beauty and his breath:\\n   \"Leave us our life and we will bring\\n   Fair gifts unto our lord, the king.\"\\n\\n2. They went together.

We left the buffalo camp about eight o\\'clock, and had a toilsome and\\nharassing march of two hours, over ridges of hills covered with a ragged\\nforest of scrub oaks, and broken by deep gullies.\\n\\n2. About ten o\\'clock in the morning we came to where this line of rugged\\nhills swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north fork of Red\\nRiver. A beautiful meadow, about half a mile wide, enameled with yellow,\\nautumnal flowers, stretched for two or three miles along the foot of the\\nhills, bordered on the opposite side by the river, whose banks were\\nfringed with cottonwood trees, the bright foliage of which refreshed and\\ndelighted the eye, after being wearied by the contemplation of monotonous\\nwastes of brown forest.\\n\\n3. The meadow was finely diversified by groves and clumps of trees, so\\nhappily dispersed that they seemed as if set out by the hand of art. As we\\ncast our eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we beheld a troop of\\nwild horses quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a mile distant, to our\\nright, while to our left, at nearly the same distance, were several\\nbuffaloes; some feeding, others reposing, and ruminating among the high,\\nrich herbage, under the shade of a clump of cottonwood trees. The whole\\nhad the appearance of a broad, beautiful tract of pasture land, on the\\nhighly ornamented estate of some gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing\\nabout the lawns and meadows.\\n\\n4. A council of war was now held, and it was determined to profit by the\\npresent favorable opportunity, and try our hand at the grand hunting\\nmaneuver which is called \"ringing the wild horse.\" This requires a large\\nparty of horsemen, well mounted. They extend themselves in each direction,\\nat a certain distance apart, and gradually form a ring of two or three\\nmiles in circumference, so as to surround the game. This must be done with\\nextreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily alarmed inhabitant of\\nthe prairie, and can scent a hunter a great distance, if to windward.\\n\\n5. The ring being formed, two or three ride toward the horses, which start\\noff in an opposite direction. Whenever they approach the bounds of the\\nring, however, a huntsman presents himself, and turns them from their\\ncourse. In this way they are checked, and driven back at every point, and\\nkept galloping round and round this magic circle, until, being completely\\ntired down, it is easy for hunters to ride up beside them and throw the\\nlariat over their heads. The prime horses of the most speed, courage, and\\nbottom, however, are apt to break through and escape, so that, in general,\\nit is the second-rate horses that are taken.\\n\\n6. Preparations were now made for a hunt of this kind. The pack horses\\nwere now taken into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest in a rush of\\nthe wild horses they should break away. Twenty-five men were then sent\\nunder the command of a lieutenant to steal along the edge of the valley\\nwithin the strip of wood that skirted the hills. They were to station\\nthemselves about fifty yards apart, within the edge of the woods, and not\\nadvance or show themselves until the horses dashed in that direction.\\nTwenty-five men were sent across the valley to steal in like manner along\\nthe river bank that bordered the opposite side, and to station themselves\\namong the trees.\\n\\n7. A third party of about the same number was to form a line, stretching\\nacross the lower part of the valley, so as to connect the two wings.\\nBeatte and our other half-breed, Antoine, together with the ever-officious\\nTonish, were to make a circuit through the woods so as to get to the upper\\npart of the valley, in the rear of the horses, and drive them forward into\\nthe kind of sack that we had formed, while the two wings should join\\nbehind them and make a complete circle.\\n\\n8. The flanking parties were quietly extending themselves out of sight, on\\neach side of the valley, and the residue were stretching themselves like\\nthe links of a chain across it, when the wild horses gave signs that they\\nscented an enemy; snuffing the air, snorting, and looking about. At length\\nthey pranced off slowly toward the river, and disappeared behind a green\\nbank.\\n\\n9. Here, had the regulations of the chase been observed, they would have\\nbeen quietly checked and turned back by the advance of a hunter from among\\nthe trees. Unluckily, however, we had our wildfire, Jack-o\\'-lantern little\\nFrenchman to deal with. Instead of keeping quietly up the right side of\\nthe valley, to get above the horses, the moment he saw them move toward\\nthe river he broke out of the covert of woods and dashed furiously across\\nthe plain in pursuit of them. This put an end to all system. The\\nhalf-breeds, and half a score of rangers, joined in the chase.\\n\\n10. A way they all went over the green bank. In a moment or two the wild\\nhorses reappeared, and came thundering down the valley, with Frenchman,\\nhalf-breeds, and rangers galloping and bellowing behind them. It was in\\nvain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to check and turn\\nback the fugitives; they were too hotly pressed by their pursuers: in\\ntheir panic they dashed through the line, and clattered down the plain.\\n\\n11. The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some of the rangers\\nwithout hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears, and others with\\nhandkerchiefs tied round their heads. The buffaloes, which had been calmly\\nruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed for a\\nmoment at the tempest that came scouring down the meadow, then turned and\\ntook to heavy, rolling flight. They were soon overtaken; the promiscuous\\nthrong were pressed together by the contracting sides of the valley, and\\naway they went, pellmell, hurry-skurry, wild buffalo, wild horse, wild\\nhuntsman, with clang and clatter, and whoop and halloo, that made the\\nforests ring.\\n\\n12. At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake, on the river bank,\\nwhile the horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with their\\npursuers close to their heels. Beatte passed several of them, having fixed\\nhis eye upon a fine Pawnee horse that had his ears slit and saddle marks\\nupon his back. He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in the woods.\\n\\n13. Among the wild horses was a fine black mare, which in scrambling up\\nthe defile tripped and fell. A young ranger sprang from his horse and\\nseized her by the mane and muzzle. Another ranger dismounted and came to\\nhis assistance. The mare struggled fiercely, kicking and biting, and\\nstriking with her fore feet, but a noose was slipped over her head, and\\nher struggles were in vain.\\n\\n14. It was some time, however, before she gave over rearing and plunging,\\nand lashing out with her feet on every side. The two rangers then led her\\nalong the valley, by two strong lariats, which enabled them to keep at a\\nsufficient distance on each side to be out of the reach of her hoofs, and\\nwhenever she struck out in one direction she was jerked in the other. In\\nthis way her spirit was gradually subdued.\\n\\n15. As to Tonish, who had marred the whole scene by his precipitancy, he\\nhad been more successful than he deserved, having managed to catch a\\nbeautiful cream-colored colt about seven months old, that had not strength\\nto keep up with its companions. The mercurial little Frenchman was beside\\nhimself with exultation. It was amusing to see him with his prize. The\\ncolt would rear and kick, and struggle to get free, when Tonish would take\\nhim about the neck, wrestle with him, jump on his back, and cut as many\\nantics as a monkey with a kitten.\\n\\n16. Nothing surprised me more, however, than to witness how soon these\\npoor animals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the prairie,\\nyielded to the dominion of man. In the course of two or three days the\\nmare and colt went with the led horses and became quite docile.\\n                                                     --Washington Irving.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

SOWING AND REAPING.\\n\\nAdelaide Anne Procter (b. 1825, d. 1864) was the daughter of Bryan Waller\\nProcter (better known as \"Barry Cornwall \"), a celebrated English poet,\\nliving in London. Miss Procter\\'s first volume, \"Legends and Lyrics,\"\\nappeared in 1858, and met with great success; it was republished in this\\ncountry. A second series, under the same name, was published in 1860; and\\nin 1862 both series were republished with additional poems, and an\\nintroduction by Charles Dickens. In 1861 Miss Procter edited \"Victoria\\nRegia,\" a collection of poetical pieces, to which she contributed; and in\\n1862 \"A Chaplet of Verses,\" composed of her own poems, was published.\\nBesides these volumes, she contributed largely to various magazines and\\nperiodicals.\\n\\n1.

TAKING COMFORT.\\n\\n1. For the last few days, the fine weather has led me away from books and\\npapers, and the close air of dwellings, into the open fields, and under\\nthe soft, warm sunshine, and the softer light of a full moon. The\\nloveliest season of the whole year--that transient but delightful interval\\nbetween the storms of the \"wild equinox, with all their wet,\" and the\\ndark, short, dismal days which precede the rigor of winter--is now with\\nus. The sun rises through a soft and hazy atmosphere; the light mist\\nclouds melt gradually before him; and his noontide light rests warm and\\nclear on still woods, tranquil waters, and grasses green with the late\\nautumnal rains.\\n\\n2. One fine morning, not long ago, I strolled down the Merrimac, on the\\nTewksbury shore. I know of no walk in the vicinity of Lowell so inviting\\nas that along the margin of the river, for nearly a mile from the village\\nof Belvidere. The path winds, green and flower-skirted, among beeches and\\noaks, through whose boughs you catch glimpses of waters sparkling and\\ndashing below. Rocks, huge and picturesque, jut out into the stream,\\naffording beautiful views of the river and the distant city.\\n\\n3. Half fatigued with my walk, I threw myself down upon a rocky slope of\\nthe bank, where the panorama of earth, sky, and water lay clear and\\ndistinct about me. Far above, silent and dim as a picture, was the city,\\nwith its huge mill masonry, confused chimney tops, and church spires; near\\nit rose the height of Belvidere, with its deserted burial place and\\nneglected gravestones sharply defined on its bleak, bare summit against\\nthe sky; before me the river went dashing down its rugged channel, sending\\nup its everlasting murmur; above me the birch tree hung its tassels; and\\nthe last wild flowers of autumn profusely fringed the rocky rim of the\\nwater.\\n\\n4. Right opposite, the Dracut woods stretched upwards from the shore,\\nbeautiful with the hues of frost, glowing with tints richer and deeper\\nthan those which Claude or Poussin mingled, as if the rainbows of a summer\\nshower had fallen among them. At a little distance to the right, a group\\nof cattle stood mid-leg deep in the river; and a troop of children,\\nbright-eyed and mirthful, were casting pebbles at them from a projecting\\nshelf of rock. Over all a warm but softened sunshine melted down from a\\nslumberous autumnal sky.\\n\\n5. My reverie was disagreeably broken. A low, grunting sound, half\\nbestial, half human, attracted my attention. I was not alone. Close beside\\nme, half hidden by a tuft of bushes, lay a human being, stretched out at\\nfull length, with his face literally rooted into the gravel. A little boy,\\nfive or six years of age, clean and healthful, with his fair brown locks\\nand blue eyes, stood on the bank above, gazing down upon him with an\\nexpression of childhood\\'s simple and unaffected pity.\\n\\n6. \"What ails you?\" asked the boy at length. \"What makes you lie there?\"\\n\\nThe prostrate groveler struggled halfway up, exhibiting the bloated and\\nfilthy countenance of a drunkard. He made two or three efforts to get upon\\nhis feet, lost his balance, and tumbled forward upon his face.\\n\\n\"What are you doing there?\" inquired the boy.\\n\\n\"I\\'m taking comfort,\" he muttered, with his mouth in the dirt.\\n\\n7. Taking his comfort! There he lay,--squalid and loathsome under the\\nbright heaven,--an imbruted man. The holy harmonies of Nature, the sounds\\nof gushing waters, the rustle of the leaves above him, the wild flowers,\\nthe frost bloom of the woods,--what were they to him? Insensible, deaf,\\nand blind, in the stupor of a living death, he lay there, literally\\nrealizing that most bitterly significant eastern malediction, \"May you eat\\ndirt.\"\\n                                                              --Whittier.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--l.

TURTLE SOUP.\\n\\nCharles Frederick Briggs (b. 1804, d. 1877) was born on the island of\\nNantucket. When quite young, however, he became a resident of New York\\nCity. In 1845, in conjunction with Edgar A. Poe, he began the publication\\nof the \"Broadway Journal;\" he was also connected with the \"New York\\nTimes,\" and the \"Evening Mirror;\" also as editor from 1853 to 1856 with\\n\"Putnam\\'s Magazine.\" Mr. Briggs wrote a few novels, some poetry, and\\nnumerous little humorous tales and sketches. The following selection is\\nfrom \"Working a Passage; or, Life on a Liner,\" one of his best stories.\\n\\n1. Among the luxuries which the captain had provided for himself and\\npassengers was a fine green turtle, which was not likely to suffer from\\nexposure to salt water, so it was reserved until all the pigs, and sheep,\\nand poultry had been eaten. A few days before we arrived, it was\\ndetermined to kill the turtle and have a feast the next day.\\n\\n2. Our cabin gentlemen had been long enough deprived of fresh meats to\\nmake them cast lickerish glances towards their hard-skinned friend, and\\nthere was a great smacking of lips the day before he was killed. As I\\nwalked aft occasionally, I heard them congratulating themselves on their\\nprospective turtle soup and forcemeat balls; and one of them, to heighten\\nthe luxury of the feast, ate nothing but a dry biscuit for the twenty-four\\nhours preceding, that he might be prepared to devour his full share of the\\nunctuous compound.\\n\\n3. It was to be a gala day with them; and though it was not champagne day,\\nthat falling on Saturday and this on Friday, they agreed to have champagne\\na day in advance, that nothing should be wanting to give a finish to their\\nturtle. It happened to be a rougher day than usual when the turtle was\\ncooked, but they had become too well used to the motion of the ship to\\nmind that.\\n\\n4. It happened to be my turn at the wheel the hour before dinner, and I\\nhad the tantalizing misery of hearing them laughing and talking about\\ntheir turtle, while I was hungry from want of dry bread and salt meat. I\\nhad resolutely kept my thoughts from the cabin during all the passage but\\nonce, and now I found my ideas clustering round a tureen of turtle in\\nspite of all my philosophy.\\n\\n5. Confound them, if they had gone out of my hearing with their exulting\\nsmacks, I should not have envied their soup, but their hungry glee so\\nexcited my imagination that I could see nothing through the glazing of the\\nbinnacle but a white plate with a slice of lemon on the rim, a loaf of\\ndelicate bread, a silver spoon, a napkin, two or three wine glasses of\\ndifferent hues and shapes, and a water goblet clustering round it, and a\\nstream of black, thick, and fragrant turtle pouring into the plate.\\n\\n6. By and by it was four bells: they dined at three. And all the\\ngentlemen, with the captain at their head, darted below into the cabin,\\nwhere their mirth increased when they caught sight of the soup plates.\\n\"Hurry with the soup, steward,\" roared the captain. \"Coming, sir,\" replied\\nthe steward. In a few moments the cook opened the door of his galley, and\\nout came the delicious steam of the turtle.\\n\\n7. Then came the steward with a large covered tureen in his hand, towards\\nthe cabin gangway. I forgot the ship for a moment in looking at this\\nprecious cargo, the wheel slipped from my hands, the ship broached to with\\na sudden jerk; the steward had got only one foot upon the stairs, when\\nthis unexpected motion threw him off his balance, and down he went by the\\nrun, the tureen slipped from his hands, and part of its contents flew into\\nthe lee scuppers, and the balance followed him in his fall.\\n\\n8. I laughed outright. I enjoyed the turtle a thousand times more than I\\nshould have done if I had eaten the whole of it. But I was forced to\\nrestrain my mirth, for the next moment the steward ran upon deck, followed\\nby the captain, in a furious rage, threatening if he caught him to throw\\nhim overboard. Not a spoonful of the soup had been left in the coppers,\\nfor the steward had taken it all away at once to keep it warm. In about an\\nhour afterwards the passengers came upon deck, looking more sober than I\\nhad seen them since we left Liverpool. They had dined upon cold ham.\\n\\n\\nDEFINTIONS.--1.

Some years ago a warehouseman in Manchester, England, published a\\nscurrilous pamphlet, in which he endeavored to hold up the house of Grant\\nBrothers to ridicule. William Grant remarked upon the occurrence that the\\nman would live to repent of what he had done; and this was conveyed by\\nsome talebearer to the libeler, who said, \"Oh, I suppose he thinks I shall\\nsome time or other be in his debt; but I will take good care of that.\" It\\nhappens, however, that a man in business can not always choose who shall\\nbe his creditors. The pamphleteer became a bankrupt, and the brothers held\\nan acceptance of his which had been indorsed to them by the drawer, who\\nhad also become a bankrupt.\\n\\n2. The wantonly libeled men had thus become creditors of the libeler! They\\nnow had it in their power to make him repent of his audacity. He could not\\nobtain his certificate without their signature, and without it he could\\nnot enter into business again. He had obtained the number of signatures\\nrequired by the bankrupt law except one. It seemed folly to hope that the\\nfirm of \"the brothers\" would supply the deficiency. What! they who had\\ncruelly been made the laughingstock of the public, forget the wrong and\\nfavor the wrongdoer? He despaired. But the claims of a wife and children\\nforced him at last to make the application. Humbled by misery, he\\npresented himself at the countinghouse of the wronged.\\n\\n3. Mr. William Grant was there alone, and his first words to the\\ndelinquent were, \"Shut the door, sir!\" sternly uttered. The door was shut,\\nand the libeler stood trembling before the libeled. He  told his tale and\\nproduced his certificate, which was instantly clutched by the injured\\nmerchant. \"You wrote a pamphlet against us once!\" exclaimed Mr. Grant. The\\nsuppliant expected to see his parchment thrown into the fire. But this was\\nnot its destination. Mr. Grant took a pen, and writing something upon the\\ndocument, handed it back to the bankrupt. He, poor wretch, expected to see\\n\"rogue, scoundrel, libeler,\" inscribed; but there was, in fair round\\ncharacters, the signature of the firm.\\n\\n4. \"We make it a rule,\" said Mr. Grant, \"never to refuse signing the\\ncertificate of an honest tradesman, and we have never heard that you were\\nanything else.\" The tears started into the poor man\\'s eyes. \"Ah,\" said Mr.\\nGrant, \"my saying was true! I said you would live to repent writing that\\npamphlet. I did not mean it as a threat. I only meant that some day you\\nwould know us better, and be sorry you had tried to injure us. I see you\\nrepent of it now.\" \"I do, I do!\" said the grateful man; \"I bitterly repent\\nit.\" \"Well, well, my dear fellow, you know us now. How do you get on? What\\nare you going to do?\" The poor man stated he had friends who could assist\\nhim when his certificate was obtained. \"But how are you off in the\\nmeantime?\"\\n\\n5. And the answer was, that, having given up every farthing to his\\ncreditors, he had been compelled to stint his family of even common\\nnecessaries, that he might be enabled to pay the cost of his certificate.\\n\"My dear fellow, this will not do; your family must not suffer. Be kind\\nenough to take this ten-pound note to your wife from me. There, there, my\\ndear fellow! Nay, do not cry; it will all be well with you yet. Keep up\\nyour spirits, set to work like a man, and you will raise your head among\\nus yet.\" The overpowered man endeavored in vain to express his thanks; the\\nswelling in his throat forbade words. He put his handkerchief to his face\\nand went out of the door, crying like a child.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ware\\'house-man (English usage), one who keeps a wholesale\\nstore for woolen goods.

She wrote verses and plays at a very early\\nage. \"The Sorrows of Rosalie,\" published in 1829, was written before she\\nwas seventeen years old. In 1827 she was married to the Hon. George\\nChapple Norton. The marriage was an unhappy one, and they were divorced in\\n1836. Her principal works are \"The Undying One,\" \"The Dream, and Other\\nPoems,\" \"The Child of the Islands,\" \"Stuart of Dunleith, a Romance,\" and\\n\"English Laws for English Women of the 19th Century.\" She contributed\\nextensively to the magazines and other periodicals.\\n\\n1.\\nA soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,\\nThere was lack of woman\\'s nursing, there was dearth of woman\\'s tears;\\nBut a comrade stood beside him, while his lifeblood ebbed away,\\nAnd bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.\\nThe dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade\\'s hand,\\nAnd he said: \"I nevermore shall see my own, my native land;\\nTake a message and a token to some distant friends of mine,\\nFor I was born at Bingen,--at Bingen on the Rhine.\\n\\n2.\\n\"Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around\\nTo hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground,\\nThat we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done,\\nFull many a corse lay ghastly pale beneath the setting sun;\\nAnd, \\'mid the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,--\\nThe death wound on their gallant breasts, the last of many scars;\\nBut some were young, and suddenly beheld life\\'s morn decline,--\\nAnd one had come from Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.\\n\\n3.\\n\"Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age,\\nFor I was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage.\\nFor my father was a soldier, and, even when a child,\\nMy heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;\\nAnd when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard,\\nI let them take whate\\'er they would, but kept my father\\'s sword;\\nAnd with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine,\\nOn the cottage wall at Bingen,--calm Bingen on the Rhine.\\n\\n4.\\n\"Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head,\\nWhen the troops come marching home again, with glad and gallant tread,\\nBut to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye,\\nFor her brother was a soldier, too, and not afraid to die;\\nAnd if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name\\nTo listen to him kindly, without regret or shame,\\nAnd to hang the old sword in its place (my father\\'s sword and mine),\\nFor the honor of old Bingen,--dear Bingen on the Rhine.\\n\\n5.\\n\"There\\'s another,--not a sister; in the happy days gone by,\\nYou\\'d have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;\\nToo innocent for coquetry,--too fond for idle scorning,--\\nO friend!

THE WINGED WORSHIPERS.\\n\\nCharles Sprague (b. 1791, d. 1875) was born in Boston, Mass. He engaged in\\nmercantile business when quite young, leaving school for that purpose. In\\n1825, he was elected cashier of the Globe Bank of Boston, which position\\nhe held until 1864. Mr. Sprague has not been a prolific writer; but his\\npoems, though few in number, are deservedly classed among the best\\nproductions of American poets. His chief poem is entitled \"Curiosity.\"\\n\\n1.

THE PEEVISH WIFE.\\n\\nMaria Edgeworth (b. 1767, d. 1849) was born near Reading. Berkshire,\\nEngland. In 1782 her father removed with his family to Edgeworthtown,\\nIreland, to reside on his estate. She lived here during the remainder of\\nher life, with the exception of occasional short visits to England,\\nScotland, and France. She was educated principally by her father, and they\\nwere colaborers in literary productions, among which were \"Essays on\\nPractical Education,\" and the \"Parent\\'s Assistant.\" Her novels and tales\\nwere written without assistance, and her fame as a writer rests on them.\\nThe best known of these are \"Castle Rackrent,\" \"Moral Tales,\" \"Tales of\\nFashionable Life,\" \"Frank,\" \"The Modern Griselda,\" and \"Helen.\" Miss\\nEdgeworth excels in the truthful delineation of character, and her works\\nare full of practical good sense and genuine humor.\\n\\nMrs. Bollingbroke. I wish I knew what was the matter with me this morning.\\nWhy do you keep the newspaper all to yourself, my dear?\\n\\nMr. Bolingbroke. Here it is for you, my dear; I have finished it. Mrs. B.\\nI humbly thank you for giving it to me when you have done with it. I hate\\nstale news. Is there anything in the paper? for I can not be at the\\ntrouble of hunting it.\\n\\nMr. B. Yes, my dear; there are the marriages of two of our friends.\\n\\nMrs.B. Who? Who?\\n\\nMr. B. Your friend, the widow Nettleby, to her cousin John Nettleby.\\n\\nMrs. B. Mrs. Nettleby? Dear! But why did you tell me?\\n\\nMr. B. Because you asked me, my dear.\\n\\nMrs. B. Oh, but it is a hundred times pleasanter to read the paragraph\\none\\'s self. One loses all the pleasure of the surprise by being told.\\nWell, whose was the other marriage?\\n\\nMr. B. Oh, my dear, I will not tell you; I will leave you the pleasure of\\nthe surprise.\\n\\nMrs. B. But you see I can not find it. How provoking you are, my dear! Do\\npray tell me.\\n\\nMr. B. Our friend Mr. Granby.\\n\\nMrs. B. Mr. Granby? Dear! Why did you not make me guess? I should have\\nguessed him directly. But why do you call him our friend? I am sure he is\\nno friend of mine, nor ever was. I took an aversion to him, as you\\nremember, the very first day I saw him. I am sure he is no friend of mine.\\n\\n\\nMr. B. I am sorry for it, my dear; but I hope you will go and see Mrs.\\nGranby.\\n\\nMrs. B. Not I, indeed, my dear. Who was she?\\n\\nMr. B. Miss Cooke.\\n\\nMrs. B. Cooke? But, there are so many Cookes. Can\\'t you distinguish her\\nany way? Has she no Christian name?\\n\\nMr. B. Emma, I think. Yes, Emma.\\n\\nMrs. B. Emma Cooke? No; it can not be my friend Emma Cooke; for I am sure\\nshe was cut out for an old maid.\\n\\nMr. B. This lady seems to me to be cut out for a good wife.\\n\\nMrs. B. Maybe so. I am sure I\\'ll never go to see her. Pray, my dear, how\\ncame you to see so much of her?\\n\\nMr. B. I have seen very little of her, my dear. I only saw her two or\\nthree times before she was married.\\n\\nMrs. B. Then, my dear, how could you decide that she was cut out for a\\ngood wife? I am sure you could not judge of her by seeing her only two or\\nthree times, and before she was married.\\n\\nMr. B. Indeed, my love, that is a very just observation.\\n\\nMrs. B. I understand that compliment perfectly, and thank you for it, my\\ndear. I must own I can bear anything better than irony.\\n\\nMr. B. Irony? my dear, I was perfectly in earnest.\\n\\nMrs. B. Yes, yes; in earnest; so I perceive; I may naturally be dull of\\napprehension, but my feelings are quick enough; I comprehend too well.\\nYes, it is impossible to judge of a woman before marriage, or to guess\\nwhat sort of a wife she will make. I presume you speak from experience;\\nyou have been disappointed yourself, and repent your choice.\\n\\nMr. B. My dear, what did I say that was like this? Upon my word, I meant\\nno such thing. I really was not thinking of you in the least.\\n\\nMrs. B. No, you never think of me now. I can easily believe that you were\\nnot thinking of me in the least.\\n\\nMr. B. But I said that only to prove to you that I could not be thinking\\nill of you, my dear.\\n\\nMrs. B. But I would rather that you thought ill of me than that you should\\nnot think of me at all.\\n\\nMr. B. Well, my dear, I will even think ill of you if that will please\\nyou.\\n\\nMrs. B. Do you laugh at me? When it comes to this I am wretched indeed.\\nNever man laughed at the woman he loved. As long as you had the slightest\\nremains of love for me you could not make me an object of derision;\\nridicule and love are incompatible, absolutely incompatible. Well, I have\\ndone my best, my very best, to make you happy, but in vain. I see I am not\\ncut out to be a good wife. Happy, happy Mrs. Granby!\\n\\nMr. B. Happy, I hope sincerely, that she will be with my friend; but my\\nhappiness must depend on you, my love; so, for my sake, if not for your\\nown, be composed, and do not torment yourself with such fancies.\\n\\nMrs. B. I do wonder whether this Mrs. Granby is really that Miss Emma\\nCooke. I\\'ll go and see her directly; see her I must.\\n\\nMr. B. I am heartily glad of it, my dear; for I am sure a visit to his\\nwife will give my friend Granby real pleasure.\\n\\nMrs. B. I promise you, my dear, I do not go to give him pleasure, or you\\neither, but to satisfy my own curiosity.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--I\\'ron-y, language intended to convey a meaning contrary to\\nits literal signification. De-ri\\'sion, the act of laughing at in contempt.\\nIn-com-pat\\'i-ble, that can not exist together.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXXIX. THE RAINY DAY.\\n\\n1. The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;\\n   It rains, and the wind is never weary;\\n   The vine still clings to the moldering wall,\\n   But at every gust the dead leaves fall.\\n     And the day is dark and dreary.\\n\\n2. My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;\\n   It rains, and the wind is never weary;\\n   My thoughts still cling to the moldering Past,\\n   But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,\\n     And the days are dark and dreary.\\n\\n3. Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;\\n   Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;\\n   Thy fate is the common fate of all,\\n   Into each life some rain must fall,\\n     Some days must be dark and dreary.\\n                                         --Longfellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nXC. BREAK, BREAK, BREAK.\\n\\nAlfred Tennyson (b. 1809, d. 1892) was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire,\\nEngland. He graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first volume of\\npoems was published in 1830, but it made little impression and was\\nseverely criticised. On the publication of his third series in 1842, his\\npoetic genius began to receive general recognition. Mr. Tennyson was made\\npoet laureate in 1850, and was regarded as the foremost living poet of\\nEngland. For several years his residence was on the Isle of Wight. In\\n1884, he was raised to the peerage.\\n\\n1. Break, break, break,\\n     On thy cold gray stones, O sea!\\n   And I would that my tongue could utter\\n     The thoughts that arise in me.\\n\\n2. Oh, well for the fisherman\\'s boy,\\n     That he shouts with his sister at play!\\n   Oh, well for the sailor lad,\\n     That he sings in his boat on the bay!\\n\\n3. And the stately ships go on\\n     To their haven under the hill;\\n   But oh for the touch of a vanished hand,\\n     And the sound of a voice that is still!\\n\\n4. Break, break, break,\\n     At the foot of thy crags, O sea!\\n   But the tender grace of a day that is dead\\n     Will never come back to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCI. TRANSPORTATION AND PLANTING OF SEEDS.\\n\\nHenry David Thoreau (b. 1817, d. 1862). This eccentric American author and\\nnaturalist was born at Concord, Mass. He graduated at Harvard University\\nin 1837. He was a good English and classical scholar, and was well\\nacquainted with the literature of the East. His father was a maker of lead\\npencils, and he followed the business for a time, but afterwards supported\\nhimself mainly by teaching, lecturing, land surveying, and carpentering.\\nIn 1845 he built himself a small wooden house near Concord, on the shore\\nof Walden Pond, where he lived about two years. He was intimate with\\nHawthorne, Emerson, and other literary celebrities. His principal works\\nare \"Walden, or Life in the Woods,\" \"A Week on Concord and Merrimac\\nRivers,\" \"Excursions,\" \"Maine Woods,\" \"Cape Cod,\" \"A Yankee in Canada,\"\\nand \"Letters to Various Persons.\" In descriptive power Mr. Thoreau has\\nfew, if any, superiors.\\n\\n1. In all the pines a very thin membrane, in appearance much like an\\ninsect\\'s wing, grows over and around the seed, and independent of it,\\nwhile the latter is being developed within its base. In other words, a\\nbeautiful thin sack is woven around the seed, with a handle to it such as\\nthe wind can take hold of, and it is then committed to the wind, expressly\\nthat it may transport the seed and extend the range of the species; and\\nthis it does as effectually as when seeds are sent by mail, in a different\\nkind of sack, from the patent office.\\n\\n2. There is, then, no necessity for supposing that the pines have sprung\\nup from nothing, and I am aware that I am not at all peculiar in asserting\\nthat they come from seeds, though the mode of their propagation by Nature\\nhas been but little attended to. They are very extensively raised from the\\nseed in Europe, and are beginning to be here.\\n\\n3. When you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will not at once spring up\\nthere unless there are, or have been quite recently, seed-bearing pines\\nnear enough for the seeds to be blown from them. But, adjacent to a forest\\nof pines, if you prevent other crops from growing there, you will surely\\nhave an extension of your pine forest, provided the soil is suitable.\\n\\n4. As I walk amid hickories, even in August, I hear the sound of green\\npignuts falling from time to time, cut off by the chickaree over my head.\\nIn the fall I notice on the ground, either within or in the neighborhood\\nof oak woods, on all sides of the town, stout oak twigs three or four\\ninches long, bearing half a dozen empty acorn cups, which twigs have been\\ngnawed off by squirrels, on both sides of the nuts, in order to make them\\nmore portable. The jays scream and the red squirrels scold while you are\\nclubbing and shaking the chestnut trees, for they are there on the same\\nerrand, and two of a trade never agree.\\n\\n5. I frequently see a red or a gray squirrel cast down a green chestnut\\nburr, as I am going through the woods, and I used to think, sometimes,\\nthat they were cast at me. In fact, they are so busy about it, in the\\nmidst of the chestnut season, that you can not stand long in the woods\\nwithout hearing one fall.\\n\\n6. A sportsman told me that he had, the day before--that was in the middle\\nof October--seen a green chestnut burr dropped on our great river meadow,\\nfifty rods from the nearest wood, and much farther from the nearest\\nchestnut tree, and he could not tell how it came there. Occasionally, when\\nchestnutting in midwinter, I find thirty or forty nuts in a pile, left in\\nits gallery just under the leaves, by the common wood mouse.\\n\\n7. But especially, in the winter, the extent to which this transportation\\nand planting of nuts is carried on, is made apparent by the snow. In\\nalmost every wood you will see where the red or gray squirrels have pawed\\ndown through the snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet deep, and\\nalmost always directly to a nut or a pine cone, as directly as if they had\\nstarted from it and bored upward,--which you and I could not have done. It\\nwould be difficult for us to find one before the snow falls. Commonly, no\\ndoubt, they had deposited them there in the fall. You wonder if they\\nremember the localities or discover them by the scent.\\n\\n8. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under a\\nthicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of evergreens in the\\nmidst of a deciduous wood. If there are any nut trees, which still retain\\ntheir nuts, standing at a distance without the wood, their paths often\\nlead directly to and from them. We, therefore, need not suppose an oak\\nstanding here and there in the wood in order to seed it, but if a few\\nstand within twenty or thirty rods of it, it is sufficient.\\n\\n9. I think that I may venture to say that every white-pine cone that falls\\nto the earth naturally in this town, before opening and losing its seeds,\\nand almost every pitch-pine one that falls at all, is cut off by a\\nsquirrel; and they begin to pluck them long before they are ripe, so that\\nwhen the crop of white-pine cones is a small one, as it commonly is, they\\ncut off thus almost everyone of these before it fairly ripens.\\n\\n10. I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so speak, in cutting\\nthem off green, is partly to prevent their opening and losing their seeds,\\nfor these are the ones for which they dig through the snow, and the only\\nwhite-pine cones which contain anything then. I have counted in one heap\\nthe cores of two hundred and thirty-nine pitch-pine cones which had been\\ncut off and stripped by the red squirrel the previous winter.\\n\\n11. The nuts thus left on the surface, or buried just beneath it, are\\nplaced in the most favorable circumstances for germinating. I have\\nsometimes wondered how those which merely fell on the surface of the earth\\ngot planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of the same\\nyear partially mixed with the mold, as it were, under the decaying and\\nmoldy leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure they want, for\\nthe nuts fall fast. In a plentiful year a large proportion of the nuts are\\nthus covered loosely an inch deep, and are, of course, somewhat concealed\\nfrom squirrels.\\n\\n12. One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid of a\\nrake, many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of January; and\\nthough some bought at the store the same day were more than half of them\\nmoldy, I did not find a single moldy one among those which I picked from\\nunder the wet and moldy leaves, where they had been snowed on once or\\ntwice. Nature knew how to pack them best. They were still plump and\\ntender. Apparently they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring they\\nare all sprouting.\\n\\n13. Occasionally, when threading the woods in the fall, you will hear a\\nsound as if some one had broken a twig, and, looking up, see a jay pecking\\nat an acorn, or you will see a flock of them at once about it, in the top\\nof an oak, and hear them break it off. They then fly to a suitable limb,\\nand placing the acorn under one foot, hammer away at it busily, making a\\nsound like a woodpecker\\'s tapping, looking round from time to time to see\\nif any foe is approaching, and soon reach the meat, and nibble at it,\\nholding up their heads to swallow while they hold the remainder very\\nfirmly with their claws. Nevertheless, it often drops to the ground before\\nthe bird has done with it.\\n\\n14. I can confirm what William Barton wrote to Wilson, the ornithologist,\\nthat \"The jay is one of the most useful agents in the economy of nature\\nfor disseminating forest trees and other nuciferous and hard-seeded\\nvegetables on which they feed. In performing this necessary duty they drop\\nabundance of seed in their flight over fields, hedges, and by fences,\\nwhere they alight to deposit them in the post holes, etc. It is remarkable\\nwhat numbers of young trees rise up in fields and pastures after a wet\\nwinter and spring. These birds alone are capable in a few years\\' time to\\nreplant all the cleared lands.\"\\n\\n15. I have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop nuts in open land,\\nwhich will still further account for the oaks and walnuts which spring up\\nin pastures; for, depend on it, every new tree comes from a seed. When I\\nexamine the little oaks, one or two years old, in such places, I\\ninvariably find the empty acorn from which they sprung.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

Much of her early life was passed on White Island, one\\nof a group of small islands, called the Isles of Shoals, about ten miles\\nfrom the shore, where she lived in the lighthouse cottage. In 1867-68, she\\npublished, in the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" a number of papers on these islands,\\nwhich were afterwards bound in a separate volume. Mrs. Thaxter was a\\ncontributor to several periodicals, and in strength and beauty of style\\nhas few equals among American writers. The following selection is from a\\nvolume of her poems entitled \"Drift Weed.\"\\n\\n1. I stood on the height in the stillness\\n     And the planet\\'s outline scanned,\\n   And half was drawn with the line of sea\\n     And half with the far blue land.\\n\\n2. With wings that caught the sunshine\\n     In the crystal deeps of the sky,\\n   Like shapes of dreams, the gleaming gulls\\n     Went slowly floating by.\\n\\n3. Below me the boats in the harbor\\n     Lay still, with their white sails furled;\\n   Sighing away into silence,\\n     The breeze died off the world.\\n\\n4. On the weather-worn, ancient ledges\\n     Peaceful the calm light slept;\\n   And the chilly shadows, lengthening,\\n     Slow to the eastward crept.\\n\\n5. The snow still lay in the hollows,\\n     And where the salt waves met\\n   The iron rock, all ghastly white\\n     The thick ice glimmered yet.\\n\\n6. But the smile of the sun was kinder,\\n     The touch of the air was sweet;\\n   The pulse of the cruel ocean seemed\\n     Like a human heart to beat.\\n\\n7. Frost-locked, storm-beaten, and lonely,\\n     In the midst of the wintry main,\\n   Our bleak rock yet the tidings heard:\\n     \"There shall be spring again!\"\\n\\n8. Worth all the waiting and watching,\\n     The woe that the winter wrought,\\n   Was the passion of gratitude that shook\\n     My soul at the blissful thought!\\n\\n9. Soft rain and flowers and sunshine,\\n     Sweet winds and brooding skies,\\n   Quick-flitting birds to fill the air\\n     With clear delicious cries;\\n\\n10. And the warm sea\\'s mellow murmur\\n      Resounding day and night;\\n    A thousand shapes and tints and tones\\n      Of manifold delight,\\n\\n11. Nearer and ever nearer\\n      Drawing with every day!\\n    But a little longer to wait and watch\\n      \\'Neath skies so cold and gray;\\n\\n12. And hushed is the roar of the bitter north\\n      Before the might of the spring,\\n    And up the frozen slope of the world\\n      Climbs summer, triumphing.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCIII. RELIGION THE ONLY BASIS OF SOCIETY.\\n\\nWilliam Ellery Channing (b. 1780, d. 1842), an eminent divine and orator,\\nwas born at Newport, R.I. He graduated from Harvard with the highest\\nhonors in 1798, and, in 1803, he was made pastor of the Federal Street\\nChurch, Boston, with which he maintained his connection until his death.\\nTowards the close of his life, being much enfeebled, he withdrew almost\\nentirely from his pastoral duties, and devoted himself to literature. Dr.\\nChanning\\'s writings are published in six volumes, and are mainly devoted\\nto theology.\\n\\n1. Religion is a social concern; for it operates powerfully on society,\\ncontributing in various ways to its stability and prosperity. Religion is\\nnot merely a private affair; the community is deeply interested in its\\ndiffusion; for it is the best support of the virtues and principles, on\\nwhich the social order rests. Pure and undefiled religion is to do good;\\nand it follows, very plainly, that if God be the Author and Friend of\\nsociety, then, the recognition of him must enforce all social duty, and\\nenlightened piety must give its whole strength to public order.\\n\\n2. Few men suspect, perhaps no man comprehends, the extent of the support\\ngiven by religion to every virtue. No man, perhaps, is aware how much our\\nmoral and social sentiments are fed from this fountain; how powerless\\nconscience would become without the belief of a God; how palsied would be\\nhuman benevolence, were there not the sense of a higher benevolence to\\nquicken and sustain it; how suddenly the whole social fabric would quake,\\nand with what a fearful crash it would sink into hopeless ruin, were the\\nideas of a Supreme Being, of accountableness and of a future life to be\\nutterly erased from every mind.\\n\\n3. And, let men thoroughly believe that they are the work and sport of\\nchance; that no superior intelligence concerns itself with human affairs;\\nthat all their improvements perish forever at death; that the weak have no\\nguardian, and the injured no avenger; that there is no recompense for\\nsacrifices to uprightness and the public good; that an oath is unheard in\\nheaven; that secret crimes have no witness but the perpetrator; that human\\nexistence has no purpose, and human virtue no unfailing friend; that this\\nbrief life is everything to us, and death is total, everlasting\\nextinction; once let them thoroughly abandon religion, and who can\\nconceive or describe the extent of the desolation which would follow?\\n\\n4. We hope, perhaps, that human laws and natural sympathy would hold\\nsociety together. As reasonably might we believe that were the sun\\nquenched in the heavens, our torches would illuminate, and our fires\\nquicken and fertilize the creation. What is there in human nature to\\nawaken respect and tenderness, if man is the unprotected insect of a day?\\nAnd what is he more, if atheism be true?\\n\\n5. Erase all thought and fear of God from a community, and selfishness and\\nsensuality would absorb the whole man. Appetite, knowing no restraint, and\\nsuffering, having no solace or hope, would trample in scorn on the\\nrestraints of human laws. Virtue, duty, principle, would be mocked and\\nspurned as unmeaning sounds. A sordid self-interest would supplant every\\nfeeling; and man would become, in fact, what the theory in atheism\\ndeclares him to be,--a companion for brutes.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

ROCK ME TO SLEEP.\\n\\nElizabeth Akers Allen (b. 1832,--) was born at Strong, Maine, and passed\\nher childhood amidst the picturesque scenery of that neighborhood. She\\nlost her mother when very young, but inherited her grace and delicacy of\\nthought. Shortly after her mother\\'s death, her father removed to\\nFarmington, Maine, a town noted for its literary people. Mrs. Allen\\'s\\nearly pieces appeared over the pseudonym of \"Florence Percy.\" Her first\\nverses appeared when she was twelve years old; and her first volume,\\nentitled \"Forest Buds from the Woods of Maine,\" was Published in 1856. For\\nsome years she was assistant editor of the \"Portland Transcript.\" The\\nfollowing selection was claimed by five different persons, who attempted\\nto steal the honor of its composition.\\n\\n1. Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight,\\n   Make me a child again, just for to-night!\\n   Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\\n   Take me again to your heart as of yore;\\n   Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\\n   Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\\n   Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\\n\\n2. Backward, flow backward, O tide of the years!\\n   I am so weary of toil and of tears;\\n   Toil without recompense, tears all in vain;\\n   Take them, and give me my childhood again!\\n   I have grown weary of dust and decay,--\\n   Weary of flinging my soul wealth away;\\n   Weary of sowing for others to reap;--\\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\\n\\n3. Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\\n   Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you!\\n   Many a summer the grass has grown green,\\n   Blossomed and faded, our faces between:\\n   Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,\\n   Long I to-night for your presence again.\\n   Come from the silence so long and so deep;--\\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\\n\\n4. Over my heart in the days that are flown,\\n   No love like mother love ever has shone;\\n   No other worship abides and endures,\\n   Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\\n   None like a mother can charm away pain\\n   From the sick soul, and the world-weary brain.\\n   Slumber\\'s soft calms o\\'er my heavy lids creep;--\\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\\n\\n5. Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\\n   Fall on your shoulders again, as of old;\\n   Let it drop over my forehead to-night,\\n   Shading my faint eyes away from the light;\\n   For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,\\n   Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\\n   Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--\\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\\n\\n6. Mother, dear mother, the years have been long\\n   Since I last listened your lullaby song;\\n   Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\\n   Womanhood\\'s years have been only a dream!\\n   Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,\\n   With your light lashes just sweeping my face,\\n   Never hereafter to wake or to weep:--\\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\\n\\n\\n\\nXCV. MAN AND THE INFERIOR ANIMALS.\\n\\n1. The chief difference between man and the other animals consists in\\nthis, that the former has reason, whereas the latter have only instinct;\\nbut, in order to understand what we mean by the terms reason and instinct,\\nit will be necessary to mention three things in which the difference very\\ndistinctly appears.\\n\\n2. Let us first, to bring the parties as nearly on a level as possible,\\nconsider man in a savage state, wholly occupied, like the beasts of the\\nfield, in providing for the wants of his animal nature; and here the first\\ndistinction that appears between them is the use of implements. When the\\nsavage provides himself with a hut or a wigwam for shelter, or that he may\\nstore up his provisions, he does no more than is done by the rabbit, the\\nbeaver, the bee, and birds of every species.\\n\\n3. But the man can not make any progress in this work without tools; he\\nmust provide himself with an ax even before he can cut down a tree for its\\ntimber; whereas these animals form their burrows, their cells, or their\\nnests, with no other tools than those with which nature has provided them.\\nIn cultivating the ground, also, man can do nothing without a spade or a\\nplow; nor can he reap what he has sown till he has shaped an implement\\nwith which to cut clown his harvest. But the inferior animals provide for\\nthemselves and their young without any of these things.\\n\\n4. Now for the second distinction. Man, in all his operations, makes\\nmistakes; animals make none. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a bird\\nsitting on a twig lamenting over her half-finished nest and puzzling her\\nlittle head to know how to complete it? Or did you ever see the cells of a\\nbeehive in clumsy, irregular shapes, or observe anything like a discussion\\nin the little community, as if there were a difference of opinion among\\nthe architects?\\n\\n5. The lower animals are even better physicians than we are; for when they\\nare ill, they will, many of them, seek out some particular herb, which\\nthey do not, use as food, and which possesses a medicinal quality exactly\\nsuited to the complaint; whereas, the whole college of physicians will\\ndispute for a century about the virtues of a single drug.\\n\\n6. Man undertakes nothing in which he is not more or less puzzled; and\\nmust try numberless experiments before he can bring his undertakings to\\nanything like perfection; even the simplest operations of domestic life\\nare not well performed without some experience; and the term of man\\'s life\\nis half wasted before he has done with his mistakes and begins to profit\\nby his lessons.\\n\\n7. The third distinction is that animals make no improvements; while the\\nknowledge, and skill, and the success of man are perpetually on the\\nincrease. Animals, in all their operations, follow the first impulse of\\nnature or that instinct which God has implanted in them. In all they do\\nundertake, therefore, their works are more perfect and regular than those\\nof man.\\n\\n8. But man, having been endowed with the faculty of thinking or reasoning\\nabout what he does, is enabled by patience and industry to correct the\\nmistakes into which he at first falls, and to go on constantly improving.\\nA bird\\'s nest is, indeed, a perfect structure; yet the nest of a swallow\\nof the nineteenth century is not at all more commodious or elegant than\\nthose that were built amid the rafters of Noah\\'s ark. But if we compare\\nthe wigwam of the savage with the temples and palaces of ancient Greece\\nand Rome, we then shall see to what man\\'s mistakes, rectified and improved\\nupon, conduct him.\\n\\n9.  \"When the vast sun shall veil his golden light\\n    Deep in the gloom of everlasting night;\\n    When wild, destructive flames shall wrap the skies,\\n    When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies;\\n    Man shall alone the wreck of worlds survive;\\n    \\'Mid falling spheres, immortal man shall live.\"\\n                                                         --Jane Taylor.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Dis-tinc\\'tion, a point of difference. Im\\'ple-ments,\\nutensils, tools. Wigwam, an Indian hut. 3. Bur\\'rows, holes in the earth\\nwhere animals lodge. 4. Dis-cus\\'sion, the act of arguing a point, debate.\\n5. Me-dic\\'i-nal, healing. 8. En-dowed\\', furnished with any gift, quality,\\netc. Fac\\'ul-ty, ability to act or perform. Rec\\'ti-fied, corrected.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCVI. THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT.\\n\\nJohn Godfrey Saxe (b. 1816, d.1887), an American humorist, lawyer, and\\njournalist, was born at Highgate, Vt. He graduated at Middlebury College\\nin 1839; was admitted to the bar in 1843; and practiced law until 1850,\\nwhen he became editor of the \"Burlington Sentinel.\" In 1851, he was\\nelected State\\'s attorney. \"Progress, a Satire, and Other Poems,\" his first\\nvolume, was published in 1849, and several other volumes of great merit\\nattest his originality. For genial humor and good-natured satire, Saxe\\'s\\nwritings rank among the best of their kind, and are very popular.\\n\\n1. It was six men of Indostan,\\n     To learning much inclined,\\n   Who went to see the elephant,\\n     (Though all of them were blind,)\\n   That each by observation\\n     Might satisfy his mind.\\n\\n2. The first approached the elephant,\\n     And, happening to fall\\n   Against his broad and sturdy side,\\n     At once began to bawl:\\n   \"God bless me! but the elephant\\n     Is very like a wall!\"\\n\\n3. The second, feeling of the tusk,\\n     Cried: \"Ha! what have we here,\\n   So very round, and smooth, and sharp?\\n     To me \\'t is very clear,\\n   This wonder of an elephant\\n     Is very like a spear!\"\\n\\n4. The third approached the animal,\\n     And, happening to take\\n   The squirming trunk within his hands,\\n     Thus boldly up he spake:\\n   \"I see,\" quoth he, \"the elephant\\n     Is very like a snake!\"\\n\\n5. The fourth reached out his eager hand,\\n     And fell about the knee:\\n   \"What most this wondrous beast is like,\\n     Is very plain,\" quoth he;\\n   \" \\'T is clear enough the elephant\\n     Is very like a tree!\"\\n\\n6. The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,\\n     Said: \"E\\'en the blindest man\\n   Can tell what this resembles most:\\n     Deny the fact who can,\\n   This marvel of an elephant\\n     Is very like a fan!\"\\n\\n7. The sixth no sooner had begun\\n     About the beast to grope,\\n   Than, seizing on the swinging tail\\n     That fell within his scope,\\n   \"I see,\" quoth he, \"the elephant\\n     Is very like a rope!\"\\n\\n8. And so these men of Indostan\\n     Disputed loud and long,\\n   Each in his own opinion\\n     Exceeding stiff and strong,\\n   Though each was partly in the right,\\n     And all were in the wrong!\\n\\n\\n\\nXCVII. A HOME SCENE.\\n\\nDonald Grant Mitchell (b. 1822,--). This popular American writer was born\\nin Norwich, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1841. In 1844 he went to\\nEngland, and, after traveling through that country on foot, spent some\\ntime on the continent. His first volume, \"Fresh Gleanings, or a New Sheaf\\nfrom the Old Fields of Continental Europe, by Ik Marvel,\" was published in\\n1847, soon after his return home. He revisited Europe in 1848. On his\\nreturn, he published \"The Battle Summer.\" Mr. Mitchell has contributed to\\nthe \"Knickerbocker Magazine,\" the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" and several\\nagricultural journals. His most popular works are \"The Reveries of a\\nBachelor,\" 1850, and \"Dream Life,\" 1851. Besides these, he has written \"My\\nFarm of Edgewood,\" \"Wet Days at Edgewood,\" \"Doctor Johns,\" a novel \"Rural\\nStudies,\" and other works. He is a charming writer. In 1853 he was\\nappointed United States consul at Venice. In 1855 he settled on a farm\\nnear New Haven, Conn., where he now resides. The following selection is\\nfrom \"Dream Life.\"\\n\\n1. Little does the boy know, as the tide of years drifts by, floating him\\nout insensibly from the harbor of his home, upon the great sea of\\nlife,--what joys, what opportunities, what affections, are slipping from\\nhim into the shades of that inexorable Past, where no man can go, save on\\nthe wings of his dreams.\\n\\n2. Little does he think, as he leans upon the lap of his mother, with his\\neye turned to her, in some earnest pleading for a fancied pleasure of the\\nhour, or in some important story of his griefs, that such sharing of his\\nsorrows, and such sympathy with his wishes, he will find nowhere again.\\n\\n3. Little does he imagine that the fond sister Nelly, ever thoughtful of\\nhis pleasures, ever smiling away his griefs, will soon be beyond the reach\\nof either; and that the waves of the years which come rocking so gently\\nunder him will soon toss her far away, upon the great swell of life.\\n\\n4. But now, you are there. The fire light glimmers upon the walls of your\\ncherished home. The big chair of your father is drawn to its wonted corner\\nby the chimney side; his head, just touched with gray, lies back upon its\\noaken top. Opposite sits your mother: her figure is thin, her look\\ncheerful, yet subdued;--her arm perhaps resting on your shoulder, as she\\ntalks to you in tones of tender admonition, of the days that are to come.\\n\\n5. The cat is purring on the hearth; the clock that ticked so plainly when\\nCharlie died is ticking on the mantel still. The great table in the middle\\nof the room, with its books and work, waits only for the lighting of the\\nevening lamp, to see a return to its stores of embroidery and of story.\\n\\n6. Upon a little stand under the mirror, which catches now and then a\\nflicker of the fire light, and makes it play, as if in wanton, upon the\\nceiling, lies that big book, reverenced of your New England parents--the\\nFamily Bible. It is a ponderous, square volume, with heavy silver clasps,\\nthat you have often pressed open for a look at its quaint, old pictures,\\nfor a study of those prettily bordered pages, which lie between the\\nTestaments, and which hold the Family Record.\\n\\n7. There are the Births;--your father\\'s and your mother\\'s; it seems as if\\nthey were born a long time ago; and even your own date of birth appears an\\nalmost incredible distance back. Then there are the Marriages;--only one\\nas yet; and your mother\\'s name looks oddly to you: it is hard to think of\\nher as anyone else than your doting parent.\\n\\n8. Last of all come the Deaths;--only one. Poor Charlie! How it looks!--\"\\nDied, 12 September, 18--, Charles Henry, aged four years.\" You know just\\nhow it looks. You have turned to it often; there you seem to be joined to\\nhim, though only by the turning of a leaf.\\n\\n9. And over your thoughts, as you look at that page of the Record, there\\nsometimes wanders a vague, shadowy fear, which will come,--that your own\\nname may soon be there. You try to drop the notion, as if it were not\\nfairly your own; you affect to slight it, as you would slight a boy who\\npresumed on your acquaintance, but whom you have no desire to know.\\n\\n10. Yet your mother--how strange it is!--has no fears of such dark\\nfancies. Even now, as you stand beside her, and as the twilight deepens in\\nthe room, her low, silvery voice is stealing upon your ear, telling you\\nthat she can not be long with you;--that the time is coming, when you must\\nbe guided by your own judgment, and struggle with the world unaided by the\\nfriends of your boyhood.\\n\\n11. There is a little pride, and a great deal more of anxiety, in your\\nthoughts now, as you look steadfastly into the home blaze, while those\\ndelicate fingers, so tender of your happiness, play with the locks upon\\nyour brow. To struggle with the world,--that is a proud thing; to struggle\\nalone,--there lies the doubt! Then crowds in swift upon the calm of\\nboyhood the first anxious thought of youth.\\n\\n12. The hands of the old clock upon the mantel that ticked off the hours\\nwhen Charlie sighed and when Charlie died, draw on toward midnight. The\\nshadows that the fireflame makes grow dimmer and dimmer. And thus it is,\\nthat Home,--boy home, passes away forever,--like the swaying of a\\npendulum,--like the fading of a shadow on the floor.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--l. In-ex\\'or-a-ble, not to be changed. 4. Wont\\'ed,\\naccustomed. Ad-mo-ni\\'tion (pro. ad-mo\\'nish\\'un), counseling against fault\\nor error. 13. Pon\\'der-ous, very heavy. Quaint (pro. kwant), odd and\\nantique. 7. In-cred\\'i-ble, impossible to be believed. Dot\\'-ing, loving to\\nexcess. 9. Vague (pro. vag), indefinite. Pre-sumed\\', pushed upon or\\nintruded in an impudent manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCVIII. THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS.\\n\\nThomas Moore (b. 1779. d. 1852) was born in Dublin, Ireland, and he was\\neducated at Trinity College in that city. In 1799, he entered the Middle\\nTemple, London, as a student of law. Soon after the publication of his\\nfirst poetical productions, he was sent to Bermuda in an official\\ncapacity. He subsequently visited the United States. Moore\\'s most famous\\nworks are: \"Lalla Rookh,\" an Oriental romance, 1817; \"The Loves of the\\nAngels,\" 1823; and \"Irish Melodies,\" 1834; a \"Life of Lord Byron,\" and\\n\"The Epicurean, an Eastern Tale.\" \"Moore\\'s excellencies,\" says Dr. Angus,\\n\"consist in the gracefulness of his thoughts, the wit and fancy of his\\nallusions and imagery, and the music and refinement of his versification.\"\\n\\n1. Oft in the stilly night\\n     Ere slumber\\'s chain has bound me,\\n   Fond memory brings the light\\n     Of other days around me:\\n       The smiles, the tears\\n       Of boyhood\\'s years,\\n     The words of love then spoken;\\n       The eyes that shone,\\n       Now dimmed and gone,\\n     The cheerful hearts now broken!\\n   Thus in the stilly night\\n     Ere slumber\\'s chain has bound me,\\n   Sad memory brings the light\\n     Of other days around me.\\n\\n2. When I remember all\\n     The friends so linked together\\n   I\\'ve seen around me fall\\n     Like leaves in wintry weather,\\n       I feel like one\\n       Who treads alone\\n     Some banquet hall deserted,\\n       Whose lights are fled\\n       Whose garlands dead,\\n     And all but he departed.\\n   Thus in the stilly night\\n     Ere slumber\\'s chain has bound me,\\n   Sad memory brings the light\\n     Of other days around me.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCIX. A CHASE IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.\\n\\nJames Fenimore Cooper (b. 1789, d. 1851). This celebrated American\\nnovelist was born in Burlington, N.J. His father removed to the state of\\nNew York about 1790, and founded Cooperstown, on Otsego Lake. He studied\\nthree years at Yale, and then entered the navy as a common sailor. He\\nbecame a midshipman in 1806, and was afterwards promoted to the rank of\\nlieutenant; but he left the service in 1811. His first novel,\\n\"Precaution,\" was published in 1819; his best work, \"The Spy,\" a tale of\\nthe Revolutionary War, in 1821. The success of \"The Spy\" was almost\\nunprecedented, and its author at once took rank among the most popular\\nwriters of the day. \"The Pilot\" and \"The Red Rover\" are considered his\\nbest sea novels. \"The Pioneers,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" \"The\\nPrairie,\" \"The Pathfinder,\" and \"The Deerslayer\" are among the best of his\\ntales of frontier life. The best of his novels have been translated into\\nnearly all of the European languages, and into some of those of Asia. \"The\\ncreations of his genius,\" says Bryant, \"shall survive through centuries to\\ncome, and only perish with our language.\" The following selection is from\\n\"The Pilot.\"\\n\\n1. The ship which the American frigate had now to oppose, was a vessel of\\nnear her own size and equipage; and when Griffith looked at her again, he\\nperceived that she had made her preparations to assert her equality in\\nmanful fight.\\n\\n2. Her sails had been gradually reduced to the usual quantity, and, by\\ncertain movements on her decks, the lieutenant and his constant attendant,\\nthe Pilot, well understood that she only wanted to lessen the distance a\\nfew hundred yards to begin the action.\\n\\n\"Now spread everything,\" whispered the stranger.\\n\\n3. Griffith applied the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted, in a voice that\\nwas carried even to his enemy, \"Let fall--out with your booms--sheet\\nhome--hoist away of everything!\"\\n\\n4. The inspiring cry was answered by a universal bustle. Fifty men flew\\nout on the dizzy heights of the different spars, while broad sheets of\\ncanvas rose as suddenly along the masts, as if some mighty bird were\\nspreading its wings. The Englishman instantly perceived his mistake, and\\nhe answered the artifice by a roar of artillery. Griffith watched the\\neffects of the broadside with an absorbing interest as the shot whistled\\nabove his head; but when he perceived his masts untouched, and the few\\nunimportant ropes, only, that were cut, he replied to the uproar with a\\nburst of pleasure.\\n\\n5. A few men were, however, seen clinging with wild frenzy to the cordage,\\ndropping from rope to rope, like wounded birds fluttering through a tree,\\nuntil they fell heavily into the ocean, the sullen ship sweeping by them\\nin a cold indifference. At the next instant, the spars and masts of their\\nenemy exhibited a display of men similar to their own, when Griffith again\\nplaced the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted aloud, \"Give it to them;\\ndrive them from their yards, boys; scatter them with your grape; unreeve\\ntheir rigging!\"\\n\\n6. The crew of the American wanted but little encouragement to enter on\\nthis experiment with hearty good will, and the close of his cheering words\\nwas uttered amid the deafening roar of his own cannon. The Pilot had,\\nhowever, mistaken the skill and readiness of their foe; for,\\nnotwithstanding the disadvantageous circumstances under which the\\nEnglishman increased his sail, the duty was steadily and dexterously\\nperformed.\\n\\n7. The two ships were now running rapidly on parallel lines, hurling at\\neach other their instruments of destruction with furious industry, and\\nwith severe and certain loss to both, though with no manifest advantage in\\nfavor of either. Both Griffith and the Pilot witnessed, with deep concern,\\nthis unexpected defeat of their hopes; for they could not conceal from\\nthemselves that each moment lessened their velocity through the water, as\\nthe shot of the enemy stripped the canvas from the yards, or dashed aside\\nthe lighter spars in their terrible progress.\\n\\n8. \"We find our equal here,\" said Griffith to the stranger. \"The ninety is\\nheaving up again like a mountain; and if we continue to shorten sail at\\nthis rate, she will soon be down upon us!\"\\n\\n\"You say true, sir,\" returned the Pilot, musing, \"the man shows judgment\\nas well as spirit; but--\"\\n\\n9. He was interrupted by Merry, who rushed from the forward part of the\\nvessel, his whole face betokening the eagerness of his spirit and the\\nimportance of his intelligence.--\\n\\n\"The breakers!\" he cried, when nigh enough to be heard amid the din; \"we\\nare running dead on a ripple, and the sea is white not two hundred yards\\nahead.\"\\n\\n10. The Pilot jumped on a gun, and, bending to catch a glimpse through the\\nsmoke, he shouted, in those clear, piercing tones, that could be even\\nheard among the roaring of the cannon,--\\n\\n\"Port, port your helm! we are on the Devil\\'s Grip! Pass up the trumpet,\\nsir; port your helm, fellow; give it to them, boys--give it to the proud\\nEnglish dogs!\"\\n\\n11. Griffith unhesitatingly relinquished the symbol of his rank, fastening\\nhis own firm look on the calm but quick eye of the Pilot, and gathering\\nassurance from the high confidence he read in the countenance of the\\nstranger. The seamen were too busy with their cannon and the rigging to\\nregard the new danger; and the frigate entered one of the dangerous passes\\nof the shoals, in the heat of a severely contested battle.\\n\\n12. The wondering looks of a few of the older sailors glanced at the\\nsheets of foam that flew by them, in doubt whether the wild gambols of the\\nwaves were occasioned by the shot of the enemy, when suddenly the noise of\\ncannon was succeeded by the sullen wash of the disturbed element, and\\npresently the vessel glided out of her smoky shroud, and was boldly\\nsteering in the center of the narrow passages.\\n\\n13. For ten breathless minutes longer the Pilot continued to hold an\\nuninterrupted sway, during which the vessel ran swiftly by ripples and\\nbreakers, by streaks of foam and darker passages of deep water, when he\\nthrew down his trumpet and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"What threatened to be our destruction has proved our salvation.--Keep\\nyonder hill crowned with wood one point open from the church tower at its\\nbase, and steer east and by north; you will run through these shoals on\\nthat course in an hour, and by so doing you will gain five leagues of your\\nenemy, who will have to double their trail.\"\\n\\n14. Every officer in the ship, after the breathless suspense of\\nuncertainty had passed, rushed to those places where a view might be taken\\nof their enemies. The ninety was still steering boldly onward, and had\\nalready approached the two-and-thirty, which lay a helpless wreck, rolling\\non the unruly seas that were rudely tossing her on their wanton billows.\\nThe frigate last engaged was running along the edge of the ripple, with\\nher torn sails flying loosely in the air, her ragged spars tottering in\\nthe breeze, and everything above her hull exhibiting the confusion of a\\nsudden and unlooked-for check to her progress.\\n\\n15. The exulting taunts and mirthful congratulations of the seamen, as\\nthey gazed at the English ships, were, however, soon forgotten in the\\nattention that was required to their own vessel. The drums beat the\\nretreat, the guns were lashed, the wounded again removed, and every\\nindividual able to keep the deck was required to lend his assistance in\\nrepairing the damages to the frigate, and securing her masts.\\n\\n16. The promised hour carried the ship safely through all the dangers,\\nwhich were much lessened by daylight; and by the time the sun had begun to\\nfall over the land, Griffith, who had not quitted the deck during the day,\\nbeheld his vessel once more cleared of the confusion of the chase and\\nbattle, and ready to meet another foe.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Frig\\'ate, a war vessel, usually carrying from\\ntwenty-eight to forty-four guns, arranged in two tiers on each side.\\nEq\\'ui-page (pro. ek\\'wi-paj), furniture, fitting out. 4.

He\\nwas born in Scotland, in 1747, and was apprenticed when only twelve years\\nold as a sailor.

BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.\\n\\nCharles Wolfe (b. 1791, d. 1823), an Irish poet and clergyman, was born in\\nDublin. He was educated in several schools, and graduated at the\\nuniversity of his native city. He was ordained in 1817, and soon became\\nnoted for his zeal and energy as a clergyman. His literary productions\\nwere collected and published in 1825. \"The Burial of Sir John Moore,\" one\\nof the finest poems of its kind in the English language, was written in\\n1817, and first appeared in the \"Newry Telegraph,\" a newspaper, with the\\nauthor\\'s initials, but without his knowledge. Byron said of this ballad\\nthat he would rather be the author of it than of any one ever written.\\n\\n1. Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,\\n     As his corse to the rampart we hurried;\\n   Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot\\n     O\\'er the grave where our hero we buried.\\n\\n2. We buried him darkly, at dead of night,\\n     The sods with our bayonets turning,\\n   By the struggling moonbeam\\'s misty light,\\n     And the lantern dimly burning.\\n\\n3. No useless coffin inclosed his breast,\\n     Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him;\\n   But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,\\n     With his martial cloak around him.\\n\\n4. Few and short were the prayers we said,\\n     And we spoke not a word of sorrow;\\n   But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead\\n     And we bitterly thought of the morrow.\\n\\n5. We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,\\n     And smoothed down his lonely pillow,\\n   That the foe and the stranger would tread o\\'er his head,\\n     And we far away on the billow!\\n\\n6. Lightly they\\'ll talk of the spirit that\\'s gone\\n     And o\\'er his cold ashes upbraid him;\\n   But little he\\'ll reck, if they\\'ll let him sleep on\\n     In a grave where a Briton has laid him.\\n\\n7. But half of our heavy task was done,\\n     When the clock struck the hour for retiring\\n   And we heard the distant random gun\\n     That the foe was sullenly firing.\\n\\n8. Slowly and sadly we laid him down,\\n     From the field of his fame, fresh and gory;\\n   We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,\\n     But we left him alone with his glory!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Mar\\'tial (pro. mar\\'shal), military. 6. Up-braid\\', to\\ncharge with something wrong or disgraceful, to reproach. Reck, to take\\nheed, to care. 7. Ran\\'dom, without fixed aim or purpose, left to chance.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--Sir John Moore (b. 1761, d. 1809) was a celebrated British general.\\nHe was appointed commander of the British forces in Spain, in the war\\nagainst Napoleon, and fell at the battle of Corunna, by a cannon shot.\\nMarshal Soult, the opposing French commander, caused a monument to be\\nerected to his memory. The British government has also raised a monument\\nto him in St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, while his native city, Glasgow, honors him\\nwith a bronze statue.\\n\\n\\n\\nCI. LITTLE VICTORIES.\\n\\n1. \"O Mother, now that I have lost my limb, I can never be a soldier or a\\nsailor; I can never go round the world!\" And Hugh burst into tears, now\\nmore really afflicted than he had ever been yet. His mother sat on the bed\\nbeside him, and wiped away his tears as they flowed, while he told her, as\\nwell as his sobs would let him, how long and how much he had reckoned on\\ngoing round the world, and how little he cared for anything else in\\nfuture; and now this was the very thing he should never be able to do!\\n\\n2. He had practiced climbing ever since he could remember, and now this\\nwas of no use; he had practiced marching, and now he should never march\\nagain. When he had finished his complaint, there was a pause, and his\\nmother said,\\n\\n\"Hugh, you have heard of Huber?\"\\n\\n\"The man who found out so lunch about bees?\" said Hugh. \"Bees and ants.\\nWhen Huber had discovered more than had ever been known about these, and\\nwhen he was sure that he could learn still more, and was more and more\\nanxious to peep into their tiny homes and curious ways, he became blind.\"\\n\\n3. Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.\\n\\n\"Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of the greatest musical\\ncomposers that ever lived. His great, his sole delight was in music. It\\nwas the passion of his life. When all his time and all his mind were given\\nto music, he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf; so that he never more\\nheard one single note from the loudest orchestra. While crowds were moved\\nand delighted with his compositions, it was all silence to him.\" Hugh said\\nnothing.\\n\\n4. \"Now do you think,\" asked his mother--and Hugh saw that a mild and\\ngentle smile beamed from her countenance--\"do you think that these people\\nwere without a Heavenly Parent?\"\\n\\n\"O no! but were they patient?\" asked Hugh.\\n\\n\"Yes, in their different ways and degrees. Would you suppose that they\\nwere hardly treated? Or would you not rather suppose that their Father\\ngave them something better to do than they had planned for themselves?\"\\n\\n5. \"He must know best, of course; but it does seem very hard that that\\nvery thing should happen to them. Huber would not have so much minded\\nbeing deaf, perhaps; or that musical man, being blind.\\n\\n\"No doubt their hearts often swelled within them at their disappointments;\\nbut I fully believe that they very soon found God\\'s will to be wiser than\\ntheir wishes. They found, if they bore their trial well, that there was\\nwork for their hearts to do far nobler than any the head could do through\\nthe eye or the ear. And they soon felt a new and delicious pleasure which\\nnone but the bitterly disappointed can feel.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n6. \"The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and of agreeing with\\nGod silently, when nobody knows what is in the breast. There is no\\npleasure like that of exercising one\\'s soul in bearing pain, and of\\nfinding one\\'s heart glow with the hope that one is pleasing God.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I feel that pleasure?\"\\n\\n\"Often and often, I have no doubt; every time you can willingly give up\\nyour wish to be a soldier or a sailor, or anything else you have set your\\nmind upon, you will feel that pleasure. But I do not expect it of you yet.\\nI dare say it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see hundreds of\\npeople in raptures with his music, when he could not hear a note of it.\"\\n\\n7. \"But did he ever smile again?\" asked Hugh.\\n\\n\"If he did, he was happier than all the fine music in the world could have\\nmade him,\" replied his mother.\\n\\n\"I wonder, oh, I wonder, if I shall ever feel so!\"\\n\\n\"We will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask him now?\" Hugh clasped his\\nhands. His mother kneeled beside the bed, and, in a very few words, prayed\\nthat Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune well, and that his friends\\nmight give him such help and comfort as God should approve.\\n\\n8. Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes, such as\\nno one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to pity as\\nthey deserved. On one occasion, when he had been quite merry for a while,\\nand his mother and his sister Agnes were chatting, they thought they heard\\na sob from the sofa. They spoke to Hugh, and found that he was indeed\\ncrying bitterly.\\n\\n\"What is it, my dear?\" said his mother. \"Agnes, have we said anything that\\ncould hurt his feelings?\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" sobbed Hugh. \"I will tell you, presently.\"\\n\\n9. And, presently, he told them that he was so busy listening to what they\\nsaid that he forgot everything else, when he felt as if something had\\ngotten between two of his toes; unconsciously he put down his hand as if\\nhis foot were there! Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in his\\ntoes; and then, when he put out his hand, and found nothing, it was so\\nterrible, it startled him so! It was a comfort to find that his mother\\nknew about this. She came, and kneeled by his sofa, and told him that many\\npersons who had lost a limb considered this the most painful thing they\\nhad to bear for some time; but that, though the feeling would return\\noccasionally through life, it would cease to be painful.\\n\\n10. Hugh was very much dejected, and when he thought of the months and\\nyears to the end of his life, and that he should never run and play, and\\nnever be like other people, he almost wished that he were dead.\\n\\nAgnes thought that he must be miserable indeed if he could venture to say\\nthis to his mother. She glanced at her mother\\'s face, but there was no\\ndispleasure there. On the contrary, she said this feeling was very\\nnatural. She had felt it herself under smaller misfortunes than Hugh\\'s;\\nbut she had found, though the prospect appeared all strewn with troubles,\\nthat they came singly, and were not so hard to bear, after all.\\n\\n11. She told Hugh that when she was a little girl she was very lazy, fond\\nof her bed, and not at all fond of dressing or washing.\\n\\n\"\\'Why, mother! you?\" exclaimed Hugh.\\n\\n\"Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was. Well, I was in despair, one\\nday, at the thought that I should have to wash, and clean my teeth, and\\nbrush my hair, and put on every article of dress, every morning, as long\\nas I lived.\"\\n\\n\"Did you tell anybody?\" asked Hugh.\\n\\n12. \"No, I was ashamed to do that; but I remember I cried. You see how it\\nturns out. When we have become accustomed to anything, we do it without\\never thinking of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us, the clock\\nthat has to tick so many millions of times, has exactly the same number of\\nseconds to do it in. So will you find that you can move about on each\\nseparate occasion, as you wish, and practice will enable you to do it\\nwithout any trouble or thought.\"\\n\\n\"But this is not all, nor half what I mean,\" said Hugh.\\n\\n13. \"No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear. You resolved to\\nbear it all patiently, I remember. But what is it you dread the most?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other people.\"\\n\\n\"Some things,\" replied his mother. \"You can never play cricket, as every\\nCrofton boy would like to do. You can never dance at your sister\\'s\\nChristmas parties.\"\\n\\n14. \"O mamma!\" cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and with the thought\\nin her mind that it was cruel to talk so.\\n\\n\"Go on! Go on!\" cried Hugh, brightening. \"You know what I feel, mother;\\nand you don\\'t keep telling me, as others do, and even sister Agnes,\\nsometimes, that it will not signify much, and that I shall not care, and\\nall that; making out that it is no misfortune, hardly, when I know what it\\nis, and they don\\'t. Now, then, go on, mother! What else?\"\\n\\n15. \"There will be little checks and mortifications continually, when you\\nsee little boys leaping over this, and climbing that, and playing at the\\nother, while you must stand out, and can only look on. And some people\\nwill pity you in a way you will not like: and some may even laugh at you.\"\\n\\n\"O mamma!\" exclaimed Agnes.\\n\\n\"Well, and what else?\" said Hugh.\\n\\n16. \"Sooner or later you will have to follow some way of life determined\\nby this accident instead of one that you would have liked better.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what else?\"\\n\\n\"I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more; and I hope there is not\\nmuch else; for, indeed, I think here is quite enough for a boy, or anyone\\nelse, to bear.\"\\n\\n\"I will bear it though; you will see.\"\\n\\n17. \"You will find great helps. These misfortunes of themselves strengthen\\none\\'s mind. They have some advantages too. You will be a better scholar\\nfor your lameness, I have no doubt. You will read more books, and have a\\nmind richer in thoughts. You will be more beloved by us all, and you\\nyourself will love God more for having given you something to bear for his\\nsake. God himself will help you to bear your trials. You will conquer your\\ntroubles one by one, and by a succession of LITTLE VICTORIES will at last\\ncompletely triumph over all.\"\\n                                                      --Harriet Martineau.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE.\\n\\nSir Henry Wotton (b. 1568, d. 1639) was born at Bocton Hall, Kent,\\nEngland. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1598 he was taken\\ninto the service of the Earl of Essex, as one of his secretaries. On the\\nEarl\\'s committal to the Tower for treason, Wotton fled to France; but he\\nreturned to England immediately after the death of Elizabeth, and received\\nthe honor of knighthood. He was King James\\'s favorite diplomatist, and, in\\n1623, was appointed provost of Eton College. Wotton wrote a number of\\nprose works; but his literary reputation rests mainly on some short poems,\\nwhich are distinguished by a dignity of thought and expression rarely\\nexcelled.\\n\\n1. How happy is he born and taught,\\n     That serveth not another\\'s will;\\n   Whose armor is his honest thought,\\n     And simple truth his utmost skill!\\n\\n2. Whose passions not his masters are,\\n     Whose soul is still prepared for death,\\n   Untied unto the worldly care\\n     Of public fame, or private breath;\\n\\n3. Who envies none that chance doth raise,\\n     Or vice; who never understood\\n   How deepest wounds are given by praise;\\n     Nor rules of state, but rules of good:\\n\\n4. Who hath his life from rumors freed,\\n     Whose conscience is his strong retreat;\\n   Whose state can neither flatterers feed,\\n     Nor ruin make oppressors great;\\n\\n5. Who God doth late and early pray,\\n     More of his grace than gifts to lend;\\n   And entertains the harmless day\\n     With a religious book or friend.\\n\\n6. This man is freed from servile bands,\\n     Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;\\n   Lord of himself, though not of lands;\\n     And having nothing, yet hath all.\\n\\n\\n\\nCIII. THE ART OF DISCOURAGEMENT.\\n\\nArthur Helps (b. 1813, d. 1875) graduated at Cambridge, England, in 1835.\\nHis best known works are: \"Friends in Council, a Series of Readings and\\nDiscourses,\" \"Companions of my Solitude,\" and \"Realmah,\" a tale of the\\n\"lake dwellers\" in southern Europe. He has also written a \"History of the\\nSpanish Conquests in America,\" two historical dramas, and several other\\nworks. Mr. Helps was a true thinker, and his writings are deservedly\\npopular with thoughtful readers. In 1859 he was appointed secretary of the\\nprivy council.\\n\\n1. Regarding, one day, in company with a humorous friend, a noble vessel\\nof a somewhat novel construction sailing slowly out of port, he observed,\\n\"What a quantity of cold water somebody must have had down his back.\" In\\nmy innocence, I supposed that he alluded to the wet work of the artisans\\nwho had been building the vessel; but when I came to know him better, I\\nfound that this was the form of comment he always indulged in when\\ncontemplating any new and great work, and that his \"somebody\" was the\\ndesigner of the vessel.\\n\\n2. My friend had carefully studied the art of discouragement, and there\\nwas a class of men whom he designated simply as \"cold-water pourers.\" It\\nwas most amusing to hear him describe the lengthened sufferings of the man\\nwho first designed a wheel; of him who first built a boat; of the\\nadventurous personage who first proposed the daring enterprise of using\\nbuttons, instead of fish bones, to fasten the scanty raiment of some\\nsavage tribe.\\n\\n3. Warming with his theme, he would become quite eloquent in describing\\nthe long career of discouragement which  these rash men had brought upon\\nthemselves, and which he said, to his knowledge, must have shortened their\\nlives. He invented imaginary dialogues between the unfortunate inventor,\\nsay of the wheel, and his particular friend, some eminent cold-water\\npourer. For, as he said, every man has some such friend, who fascinates\\nhim by fear, and to whom he confides his enterprises in order to hear the\\nworst that can be said of them.\\n\\n4. The sayings of the chilling friend, probably, as he observed, ran\\nthus:--\"We seem to have gone on very well for thousands of years without\\nthis rolling thing. Your father carried burdens on his back. The king is\\ncontent to be borne on men\\'s shoulders. The high priest is not too proud\\nto do the same. Indeed, I question whether it is not irreligious to\\nattempt to shift from men\\'s shoulders their natural burdens.\\n\\n5. \"Then, as to its succeeding,--for my part, I see no chance of that. How\\ncan it go up hill? How often you have failed before in other fanciful\\nthings of the same nature! Besides, you are losing your time; and the yams\\nabout your hut are only half planted. You will be a beggar; and it is my\\nduty, as a friend, to tell you so plainly.\\n\\n6. \"There was Nang-chung: what became of him? We had found fire for ages,\\nin a proper way, taking a proper time about it, by rubbing two sticks\\ntogether. He must needs strike out fire at once, with iron and flint; and\\ndid he die in his bed? Our sacred lords saw the impiety of that\\nproceeding, and very justly impaled the man who imitated heavenly powers.\\nAnd, even if you could succeed with this new and absurd rolling thing, the\\nstate would be ruined. What would become of those who carry burdens on\\ntheir backs? Put aside the vain fancies of a childish mind, and finish the\\nplanting of your yams.\"\\n\\n7. It is really very curious to observe how, even in modern times, the\\narts of discouragement prevail. There are men whose sole pretense to\\nwisdom consists in administering discouragement. They are never at a loss.\\nThey are equally ready to prophesy, with wonderful ingenuity, all possible\\nvarieties of misfortune to any enterprise that may be proposed; and when\\nthe thing is produced, and has met with some success, to find a flaw in\\nit.\\n\\n8. I once saw a work of art produced in the presence of an eminent\\ncold-water pourer. He did not deny that it was beautiful; but he instantly\\nfastened upon a small crack in it that nobody had observed; and upon that\\ncrack he would dilate whenever the work was discussed in his presence.\\nIndeed, he did not see the work, but only the crack in it. That\\nflaw,--that little flaw,--was all in all to him.\\n\\n9. The cold-water pourers are not all of one form of mind. Some are led to\\nindulge in this recreation from genuine timidity. They really do fear that\\nall new attempts will fail. Others are simply envious and ill-natured.\\nThen, again, there is a sense of power and wisdom in prophesying evil.\\nMoreover, it is the safest thing to prophesy, for hardly anything at first\\nsucceeds exactly in the way that it was intended to succeed.\\n\\n10. Again, there is the lack of imagination which gives rise to the\\nutterance of so much discouragement. For an ordinary man, it must have\\nbeen a great mental strain to grasp the ideas of the first projectors of\\nsteam and gas, electric telegraphs, and pain-deadening chloroform. The\\ninventor is always, in the eyes of his fellow-men, somewhat of a madman;\\nand often they do their best to make him so.\\n\\n11. Again, there is the want of sympathy; and that is, perhaps, the ruling\\ncause in most men\\'s minds who have given themselves up to discourage. They\\nare not tender enough, or sympathetic enough, to appreciate all the pain\\nthey are giving, when, in a dull plodding way, they lay out argument after\\nargument to show that the project which the poor inventor has set his\\nheart upon, and upon which, perhaps, he has staked his fortune, will not\\nsucceed.\\n\\n12. But what inventors suffer, is only a small part of what mankind in\\ngeneral endure from thoughtless and unkind discouragement. Those\\nhigh-souled men belong to the suffering class, and must suffer; but it is\\nin daily life that the wear and tear of discouragement tells so much.\\nPropose a small party of pleasure to an apt discourager, and see what he\\nwill make of it. It soon becomes sicklied over with doubt and despondency;\\nand, at last, the only hope of the proposer is, that his proposal, when\\nrealized, will not be an ignominious failure. All hope of pleasure, at\\nleast for the proposer, has long been out of the question.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Des\\'ig-nat-ed, called by a distinctive title, named. 5.\\nYam, the root of a climbing plant, found in the tropics, which is used for\\nfood. 6. Im-paled\\', put to death by being fixed on an upright, sharp\\nstake. 8. Di-late\\', to speak largely, to dwell in narration. 10. Rise\\n(pro. ris, not riz), source, origin.

THE MARINER\\'S DREAM.\\n\\nWilliam Dimond (b. 1780, d. 1837) was a dramatist and poet, living at\\nBath, England, where he was born and received his education. He afterwards\\nstudied for the bar in London. His literary productions are for the most\\npart dramas, but he has also written a number of poems, among them the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n1. In slumbers of midnight the sailor boy lay;\\n     His hammock swung loose at the sport of the wind;\\n   But watch-worn and weary, his cares flew away,\\n     And visions of happiness danced o\\'er his mind.\\n\\n2. He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,\\n     And pleasures that waited on life\\'s merry morn;\\n   While Memory each scene gayly covered with flowers,\\n     And restored every rose, but secreted the thorn.\\n\\n3. Then Fancy her magical pinions spread wide,\\n     And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise;\\n   Now, far, far behind him the green waters glide,\\n     And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes.\\n\\n4. The jessamine clambers in flowers o\\'er the thatch,\\n     And the swallow chirps sweet from her nest in the wall;\\n   All trembling with transport, he raises the latch,\\n     And the voices of loved ones reply to his call.\\n\\n5. A father bends o\\'er him with looks of delight;\\n     His cheek is impearled with a mother\\'s warm tear;\\n   And the lips of the boy in a love kiss unite\\n     With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.\\n\\n6. The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast;\\n     Joy quickens his pulses,--all his hardships seem o\\'er;\\n   And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest,--\\n     \"O God! thou hast blest me,--I ask for no more.\"\\n\\n7. Ah! whence is that flame which now bursts on his eye?\\n     Ah! what is that sound that now \\'larums his ear?\\n   \\'T is the lightning\\'s red glare painting hell on the sky!\\n     \\'T is the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!\\n\\n8. He springs from his hammock,--he flies to the deck;\\n     Amazement confronts him with images dire;\\n   Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a wreck;\\n     The masts fly in splinters; the shrouds are on fire.\\n\\n9. Like mountains the billows tremendously swell;\\n     In vain the lost wretch calls on Mercy to save;\\n   Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,\\n     And the death angel flaps his broad wings o\\'er the wave!\\n\\n10. O sailor boy, woe to thy dream of delight!\\n      In darkness dissolves the gay frostwork of bliss!\\n    Where now is the picture that Fancy touched bright,--\\n      Thy parents\\' fond pressure, and love\\'s honeyed kiss?\\n\\n11. O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again\\n      Shall home, love, or kindred, thy wishes repay;\\n    Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,\\n      Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.\\n\\n12. No tomb shall e\\'er plead to remembrance for thee,\\n      Or redeem form or fame from the merciless surge;\\n    But the white foam of waves shall thy winding sheet be,\\n      And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge.\\n\\n13. On a bed of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid,--\\n      Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;\\n    Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made,\\n      And every part suit to thy mansion below.\\n\\n14. Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away,\\n      And still the vast waters above thee shall roll;\\n    Earth loses thy pattern forever and aye;\\n      O sailor boy! sailor boy! peace to thy soul!\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ham\\'mock, a hanging or swinging bed, usu-ally made of\\nnetting or hempen cloth. 4. Trans\\'port, ecstasy, rapture. 5. Im-pearled\\'\\n(pro. im-perled\\'), decorated with pearls, or with things resembling\\npearls. 7. \\'Lar\\'ums (an abbreviation of alarums, for alarms), affrights,\\nterrifies. 12. Dirge, funeral music.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--13. Coral is the solid part of a minute sea animal, corresponding\\nto the bones in other animals. It grows in many fantastic shapes, and is\\nof various colors.\\n\\nAmber is a yellow resin, and is the fossilized gum of buried trees. It is\\nmined in several localities in Europe and America; it is also found along\\nthe seacoast, washed up by the waves.\\n\\n\\n\\nCV. THE PASSENGER PIGEON.\\n\\nJohn James Audubon (b. 1780, d. 1851). This celebrated American\\nornithologist was born in Louisiana. When quite young he was passionately\\nfond of birds, and took delight in studying their habits. In 1797 his\\nfather, an admiral in the French navy, sent him to Paris to be educated.\\nOn his return to America, he settled on a farm in eastern Pennsylvania,\\nbut afterward removed to Henderson, Ky., where he resided several years,\\nsupporting his family by trade, but devoting most of his time to the\\npursuit of his favorite study. In 1826 he went to England, and commenced\\nthe publication of the \"Birds of America,\" which consists of ten\\nvolumes--five of engravings of birds, natural size, and five of\\nletterpress. Cuvier declares this work to be \"the most magnificent\\nmonument that art has ever erected to ornithology.\" In 1830 Audubon\\nreturned to America, and soon afterwards made excursions into nearly every\\nsection of the United States and Canada. A popular edition of his great\\nwork was published, in seven volumes, in 1844, and \"The Quadrupeds of\\nAmerica,\" in six volumes,--three of plates and three of letterpress, in\\n1846-50. He removed to the vicinity of New York about 1840, and resided\\nthere until his death.\\n\\n1. The multitudes of wild pigeons in our woods are astonishing. Indeed,\\nafter having viewed them so often, and under so many circumstances, I even\\nnow feel inclined to pause and assure myself that what I am going to\\nrelate is a fact. Yet I have seen it all, and that, too, in the company of\\npersons who, like myself, were struck with amazement.\\n\\n2. In the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Henderson, on the banks of the\\nOhio, on my way to Louisville. In passing over the Barrens, a few miles\\nbeyond Hardinsburgh, I observed the pigeons flying, from northeast to\\nsouthwest, in greater numbers than I thought I had ever seen them before,\\nand feeling an inclination to count the flocks that might pass within the\\nreach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated myself on an eminence,\\nand began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every flock that\\npassed.\\n\\n3. In a short time, finding the task which I had undertaken impracticable,\\nas the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and, counting the\\ndots then put down, found that one hundred and sixty-three had been made\\nin twenty-one minutes. I traveled on, and still met more the farther I\\nproceeded. The air was literally filled with pigeons; the light of noonday\\nwas obscured as by an eclipse; and the continued buzz of wings had a\\ntendency to lull my senses to repose.\\n\\n4. Whilst waiting for dinner at Young\\'s inn, at the confluence of Salt\\nRiver with the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure, immense legions still going by,\\nwith a front reaching far beyond the Ohio on the west, and the beech wood\\nforests directly on the east of me. Not a single bird alighted, for not a\\nnut or acorn was that year to be seen in the neighborhood. They\\nconsequently flew so high that different trials to reach them with a\\ncapital rifle proved ineffectual; nor did the reports disturb them in the\\nleast.\\n\\n5. I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their aerial evolutions\\nwhen a hawk chanced to press upon the rear of a flock. At once, like a\\ntorrent, and with a noise like thunder, they rushed into a compact mass,\\npressing upon each other towards the center. In these almost solid masses,\\nthey darted forward in undulating and angular lines, descended and swept\\nclose over the earth with inconceivable velocity, mounted perpendicularly\\nso as to resemble a vast column, and, when high, were seen wheeling and\\ntwisting within their continued lines, which then resembled the coils of a\\ngigantic serpent.\\n\\n6. As soon as the pigeons discover a sufficiency of food to entice them to\\nalight, they fly round in circles, reviewing the country below. During\\ntheir evolutions, on such occasions, the dense mass which they form\\nexhibits a beautiful appearance, as it changes its direction, now\\ndisplaying a glistening sheet of azure, when the backs of the birds come\\nsimultaneously into view, and anon suddenly presenting a mass of rich,\\ndeep purple.\\n\\n7. They then pass lower, over the woods, and for a moment are lost among\\nthe foliage, but again emerge, and are seen gliding aloft. They now\\nalight; but the next moment, as if suddenly alarmed, they take to wing,\\nproducing by the flappings of their wings a noise like the roar of distant\\nthunder, and sweep through the forests to see if danger is near. Hunger,\\nhowever, soon brings them to the ground.\\n\\n8. When alighted, they are seen industriously throwing up the withered\\nleaves in quest of the fallen mast. The rear ranks are continually rising,\\npassing over the main body, and alighting in front, in such rapid\\nsuccession, that the whole flock seems still on wing. The quantity of\\nground thus swept is astonishing; and so completely has it been cleared\\nthat the gleaner who might follow in their rear would find his labor\\ncompletely lost.\\n\\n9. On such occasions, when the woods are filled with these pigeons, they\\nare killed in immense numbers, although no apparent diminution ensues.\\nAbout the middle of the day, after their repast is finished, they settle\\non the trees to enjoy rest and digest their food. As the sun begins to\\nsink beneath the horizon; they depart en masse for the roosting place,\\nwhich not unfrequently is hundreds of miles distant, as has been\\nascertained by persons who have kept an account of their arrivals and\\ndepartures.\\n\\n10. Let us now inspect their place of nightly rendezvous. One of these\\ncurious roosting places, on the banks of the Green River, in Kentucky, I\\nrepeatedly visited. It was, as is always the case, in a portion of the\\nforest where the trees were of great magnitude, and where there was little\\nunderwood. I rode through it upwards of forty miles, and, crossing it in\\ndifferent parts, found its average breadth to be rather more than three\\nmiles. My first view of it was about a fortnight subsequent to the period\\nwhen they had made choice of it, and I arrived there nearly two hours\\nbefore sunset.\\n\\n11. Many trees, two feet in diameter, I observed, were broken off at no\\ngreat distance from the ground; and the branches of many of the largest\\nand tallest had given way, as if the forest had been swept by a tornado.\\nEverything proved to me that the number of birds resorting to this part of\\nthe forest must be immense beyond conception.\\n\\n12. As the period of their arrival approached, their foes anxiously\\nprepared to receive them. Some were furnished with iron pots containing\\nsulphur, others with torches of pine knots, many with poles, and the rest\\nwith guns. The sun was lost to our view, yet not a pigeon had arrived.\\nEverything was ready, and all eyes were gazing on the clear sky, which\\nappeared in glimpses amidst the tall trees. Suddenly there burst forth the\\ngeneral cry of, \"Here they come!\"\\n\\n13. The noise which they made, though yet distant, reminded me of a hard\\ngale at sea passing through the rigging of a close-reefed vessel. As the\\nbirds arrived and passed over me, I felt a current of air that surprised\\nme. Thousands were soon knocked down by the pole men. The birds continued\\nto pour in. The fires were lighted, and a magnificent as well as wonderful\\nand almost terrifying sight presented itself.\\n\\n14. The pigeons, arriving by thousands, alighted everywhere, one above\\nanother, until solid masses, as large as hogsheads, were formed on the\\nbranches all round. Here and there the perches gave way under the weight\\nwith a crash, and falling to the ground destroyed hundreds of the birds\\nbeneath, forcing down the dense groups with which every stick was loaded.\\nIt was a scene of uproar and confusion. I found it quite useless to speak\\nor even to shout to those persons who were nearest to me. Even the reports\\nof the guns were seldom heard, and I was made aware of the firing only by\\nseeing the shooters reloading.\\n\\n15. The uproar continued the whole night; and as I was anxious to know to\\nwhat distance the sound reached, I sent off a man, accustomed to\\nperambulate the forest, who, returning two hours afterwards, informed me\\nhe had heard it distinctly when three miles distant from the spot. Towards\\nthe approach of day, the noise in some measure subsided; long before\\nobjects were distinguishable, the pigeons began to move off in a direction\\nquite different from that in which they had arrived the evening before,\\nand at sunrise all that were able to fly had disappeared.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--5. A-e\\'ri-al, belonging or pertaining to the air. 6. A-non\\',\\nin a short time, soon. 8. Mast, the fruit of oak and beech or other forest\\ntrees. 10. Ren\\'dez-vous  (pro. ren\\'de-voo), an appointed or customary\\nplace of meeting. Sub\\'se-quent, following in time. 15. Per-am\\'bu-late, to\\nwalk through.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The wild pigeon, in common with almost every variety of game, is\\nbecoming more scarce throughout the country each year; and Audubon\\'s\\naccount, but for the position he holds, would in time, no doubt, be\\nconsidered ridiculous.\\n\\n9. En masse (pro. aN mas), a French phrase meaning in a body.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s note: The last Passenger Pigeon died at the Cincinnati Zoo\\non September 1, 1914. Population estimates  ranged up to 5 billion,\\ncomprising 40% of the total number of birds in North America in the 19th\\ncentury.]\\n\\n\\n\\nCVI. THE COUNTRY LIFE.\\n\\nRichard Henry Stoddard (b. 1825,--) was born at Hingham, Mass., but\\nremoved to New York City while quite young. His first volume of poems,\\n\"Foot-prints,\" appeared in 1849, and has been followed by many others. Of\\nthese may be mentioned \"Songs of Summer,\" \"Town and Country,\" \"The King\\'s\\nBell,\" \"Abraham Lincoln\" (an ode), and the \"Book of the East,\" from the\\nlast of which the following selection is abridged. Mr. Stoddard\\'s verses\\nare full of genuine feeling, and some of them show great poetic power.\\n\\n1. Not what we would, but what we must,\\n     Makes up the sum of living:\\n   Heaven is both more and less than just,\\n     In taking and in giving.\\n   Swords cleave to hands that sought the plow,\\n   And laurels miss the soldier\\'s brow.\\n\\n2. Me, whom the city holds, whose feet\\n     Have worn its stony highways,\\n   Familiar with its loneliest street,--\\n     Its ways were never my ways.\\n   My cradle was beside the sea,\\n   And there, I hope, my grave will be.\\n\\n3. Old homestead! in that old gray town\\n     Thy vane is seaward blowing;\\n   Thy slip of garden stretches down\\n     To where the tide is flowing;\\n   Below they lie, their sails all furled,\\n   The ships that go about the world.\\n\\n4. Dearer that little country house,\\n     Inland with pines beside it;\\n   Some peach trees, with unfruitful boughs,\\n     A well, with weeds to hide it:\\n   No flowers, or only such as rise\\n   Self-sown--poor things!--which all despise.\\n\\n5. Dear country home! can I forget\\n     The least of thy sweet trifles?\\n   The window vines that clamber yet,\\n     Whose blooms the bee still rifles?\\n   The roadside blackberries, growing ripe,\\n   And in the woods the Indian pipe?\\n\\n6. Happy the man who tills his field,\\n     Content with rustic labor;\\n   Earth does to him her fullness yield,\\n     Hap what may to his neighbor.\\n   Well days, sound nights--oh, can there be\\n   A life more rational and free?\\n\\nNOTE.--5. The Indian pipe is a little, white plant, bearing a white,\\nbell-shaped flower.\\n\\n\\n\\nCVII. THE VIRGINIANS.\\n\\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray (b. 1811, d. 1863). This popular English\\nhumorist, essayist, and novelist was born in Calcutta. He was educated at\\nthe Charterhouse school in London, and at Cambridge, but he did not\\ncomplete a collegiate course of study. He began his literary career as a\\ncontributor to \"Fraser\\'s Magazine,\" under the assumed name of Michael\\nAngelo Titmarsh, and afterwards contributed to the column of \"Punch.\" The\\nfirst novel published under Thackeray\\'s own name was \"Vanity Fair,\" which\\nis regarded by many as his greatest work. He afterwards wrote a large\\nnumber of novels, tales, and poems, most of which were illustrated by\\nsketches drawn by himself. His course of \"Lectures on the English\\nHumorists\" was delivered in London in 1851, and the following year in\\nseveral cities in the United States. He revisited the United States in\\n1856, and delivered a course of lectures on \"The Four Georges,\" which he\\nrepeated in Great Britain soon after his return home. In 1860 he became\\nthe editor of \"The Cornhill Magazine,\" the most successful serial ever\\npublished in England.\\n\\n1. Mr. Esmond called his American house Castlewood, from the patrimonial\\nhome in the old country. The whole usages of Virginia, indeed, were fondly\\nmodeled after the English customs. It was a loyal colony. The Virginians\\nboasted that King Charles the Second had been king in Virginia before he\\nhad been king in England. English king and English church were alike\\nfaithfully honored there.\\n\\n2. The resident gentry were allied to good English families. They held\\ntheir heads above the Dutch traders of New York, and the money-getting\\nRoundheads of Pennsylvania and New England. Never were people less\\nrepublican than those of the great province which was soon to be foremost\\nin the memorable revolt against the British Crown.\\n\\n3. The gentry of Virginia dwelt on their great lands after a fashion\\nalmost patriarchal. For its rough cultivation, each estate had a multitude\\nof hands--of purchased and assigned servants--who were subject to the\\ncommand of the master. The land yielded their food, live stock, and game.\\n\\n4. The great rivers swarmed with fish for the taking. From their banks the\\npassage home was clear. Their ships took the tobacco off their private\\nwharves on the banks of the Potomac or the James River, and carried it to\\nLondon or Bristol,--bringing back English goods and articles of home\\nmanufacture in return for the only produce which the Virginian gentry\\nchose to cultivate.\\n\\n5. Their hospitality was boundless. No stranger was ever sent away from\\ntheir gates. The gentry received one another, and traveled to each other\\'s\\nhouses, in a state almost feudal. The question of slavery was not born at\\nthe time of which we write. To be the proprietor of black servants shocked\\nthe feelings of no Virginia gentleman; nor, in truth, was the despotism\\nexercised over the negro race generally a savage one. The food was plenty:\\nthe poor black people lazy and not unhappy. You might have preached negro\\nemancipation to Madam Esmond of Castlewood as you might have told her to\\nlet the horses run loose out of the stables; she had no doubt but that the\\nwhip and the corn bag were good for both.\\n\\n6. Her father may have thought otherwise, being of a skeptical turn on\\nvery many points, but his doubts did not break forth in active denial, and\\nhe was rather disaffected than rebellious, At one period, this gentleman\\nhad taken a part in active life at home, and possibly might have been\\neager to share its rewards; but in latter days he did not seem to care for\\nthem. A something had occurred in his life, which had cast a tinge of\\nmelancholy over all his existence.\\n\\n7. He was not unhappy,--to those about him most kind,--most affectionate,\\nobsequious even to the women of his family, whom he scarce ever\\ncontradicted; but there had been some bankruptcy of his heart, which his\\nspirit never recovered. He submitted to life, rather than enjoyed it, and\\nnever was in better spirits than in his last hours when he was going to\\nlay it down.\\n\\n8. When the boys\\' grandfather died, their mother, in great state,\\nproclaimed her eldest son George her successor and heir of the estate; and\\nHarry, George\\'s younger brother by half an hour, was always enjoined to\\nrespect his senior. All the household was equally instructed to pay him\\nhonor; the negroes, of whom there was a large and happy family, and the\\nassigned servants from Europe, whose lot was made as bearable as it might\\nbe under the government of the lady of Castlewood.\\n\\n9. In the whole family there scarcely was a rebel save Mrs. Esmond\\'s\\nfaithful friend and companion, Madam Mountain, and Harry\\'s foster mother,\\na faithful negro woman, who never could be made to understand why her\\nchild should not be first, who was handsomer, and stronger, and cleverer\\nthan his brother, as she vowed; though, in truth, there was scarcely any\\ndifference in the beauty, strength, or stature of the twins.\\n\\n10. In disposition, they were in many points exceedingly unlike; but in\\nfeature they resembled each other so closely, that, but for the color of\\ntheir hair, it had been difficult to distinguish them. In their beds, and\\nwhen their heads were covered with those vast, ribboned nightcaps, which\\nour great and little ancestors wore, it was scarcely possible for any but\\na nurse or a mother to tell the one from the other child.\\n\\n11. Howbeit, alike in form, we have said that they differed in temper. The\\nelder was peaceful, studious, and silent; the younger was warlike and\\nnoisy. He was quick at learning when he began, but very slow at beginning.\\nNo threats of the ferule would provoke Harry to learn in an idle fit, or\\nwould prevent George from helping his brother in his lesson. Harry was of\\na strong military turn, drilled the little negroes on the estate, and\\ncaned them like a corporal, having many good boxing matches with them, and\\nnever bearing malice if he was worsted;--whereas George was sparing of\\nblows, and gentle with all about him.\\n\\n12. As the custom in all families was, each of the boys had a special\\nlittle servant assigned him: and it was a known fact that George, finding\\nhis little wretch of a blackamoor asleep on his master\\'s bed, sat down\\nbeside it, and brushed the flies off the child with a feather fan, to the\\nhorror of old Gumbo, the child\\'s father, who found his young master so\\nengaged, and to the indignation of Madam Esmond, who ordered the young\\nnegro off to the proper officer for a whipping. In vain George implored\\nand entreated--burst into passionate tears, and besought a remission of\\nthe sentence. His mother was inflexible regarding the young rebel\\'s\\npunishment, and the little negro went off beseeching his young master not\\nto cry.\\n\\n13. On account of a certain apish drollery and humor which exhibited\\nitself in the lad, and a liking for some of the old man\\'s pursuits, the\\nfirst of the twins was the grandfather\\'s favorite and companion, and would\\nlaugh and talk out all his infantine heart to the old gentleman, to whom\\nthe younger had seldom a word to say.\\n\\n14. George was a demure, studious boy, and his senses seemed to brighten\\nup in the library, where his brother was so gloomy. He knew the books\\nbefore he could well-nigh carry them, and read in them long before he\\ncould understand them. Harry, on the other hand, was all alive in the\\nstables or in the wood, eager for all parties of hunting and fishing, and\\npromised to be a good sportsman from a very early age.\\n\\n15. At length the time came when Mr. Esmond was to have done with the\\naffairs of this life, and he laid them down as if glad to be rid of their\\nburden. All who read and heard that discourse, wondered where Parson\\nBroadbent of James Town found the eloquence and the Latin which adorned\\nit. Perhaps Mr. Dempster knew, the boys\\' Scotch tutor, who corrected the\\nproofs of the oration, which was printed, by the desire of his Excellency\\nand many persons of honor, at Mr. Franklin\\'s press in Philadelphia.\\n\\n16. No such sumptuous funeral had ever bean seen in the country as that\\nwhich Madam Esmond Warrington ordained for her father, who would have been\\nthe first to smile at that pompous grief.\\n\\n17. The little lads of Castlewood, almost smothered in black trains and\\nhatbands, headed the procession and were followed by my Lord Fairfax, from\\nGreenway Court, by his Excellency the Governor of Virginia (with his\\ncoach), by the Randolphs, the Careys, the Harrisons, the Washingtons, and\\nmany others; for the whole country esteemed the departed gentleman, whose\\ngoodness, whose high talents, whose benevolence and unobtrusive urbanity,\\nhad earned for him the just respect of his neighbors. 18. When informed of\\nthe event, the family of Colonel Esmond\\'s stepson, the Lord Castlewood of\\nHampshire in England, asked to be at the charges of the marble slab which\\nrecorded the names and virtues of his lordship\\'s mother and her husband;\\nand after due time of preparation, the monument was set up, exhibiting the\\narms and coronet of the Esmonds, supported by a little, chubby group of\\nweeping cherubs, and reciting an epitaph which for once did not tell any\\nfalsehoods.\\n\\n\\nDEFINTIONS.--1. Pat-ri-mo\\'ni-al, inherited from ancestors. 6.\\nDis-af-fect\\'ed, discouraged. 7. Ob-se\\'qui-ous, compliant to excess. 12.\\nBlack\\'a-moor, a negro. 17. Ur-ban\\'i-ty, civility or courtesy of manners,\\nrefinement. 18. Ep\\'i-taph (pro. ep\\'i-taf), an inscription on a monument,\\nin honor or in memory of the dead.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--2. Roundhead was the epithet applied to the Puritans by the\\nCavaliers in the time of Charles I. It arose from the practice among the\\nPuritans of cropping their hair peculiarly.\\n\\n3. Patriarchal. 5. Feudal. The Jewish patriarch, in olden times, and the\\nhead of a noble family in Europe, during the Middle Ages, when the \"Feudal\\nSystem,\" as it is called, existed, both held almost despotic sway, the one\\nover his great number of descendants and relations, and the other over a\\nvast body of   subjects or retainers. Both patriarch and feudal lord were\\nless restricted than the modern king, and the feudal lord, especially,\\nlived in a state of great magnificence.\\n\\n15. Proofs. When matter is to be printed, a rough impression of it is\\ntaken as soon as the type is set up, and sent to the editor or some other\\nauthority for correction. These first sheets are called proofs.\\n\\n\"His Excellency\" was the title applied to the governor.\\n\\n\\n\\nCVIII. MINOT\\'S LEDGE.\\n\\nFitz-James O\\'Brien (b. 1828, d. 1862) was of Irish birth, and came to\\nAmerica in 1852. He has contributed a number of tales and poems to various\\nperiodicals, but his writings have never been collected in book form. Mr.\\nO\\'Brien belonged to the New York Seventh Regiment, and died at Baltimore\\nof a wound received in a cavalry skirmish.\\n\\n1. Like spectral hounds across the sky,\\n     The white clouds scud before the storm;\\n   And naked in the howling night\\n     The red-eyed lighthouse lifts its form.\\n   The waves with slippery fingers clutch\\n     The massive tower, and climb and fall,\\n   And, muttering, growl with baffled rage\\n     Their curses on the sturdy wall.\\n\\n2. Up in the lonely tower he sits,\\n     The keeper of the crimson light:\\n   Silent and awe-struck does he hear\\n     The imprecations of the night.\\n   The white spray beats against the panes\\n     Like some wet ghost that down the air\\n   Is hunted by a troop of fiends,\\n     And seeks a shelter anywhere.\\n\\n3. He prays aloud, the lonely man,\\n     For every soul that night at sea,\\n   But more than all for that brave boy\\n     Who used to gayly climb his knee,--\\n   Young Charlie, with his chestnut hair,\\n     And hazel eyes, and laughing lip.\\n   \"May Heaven look down,\" the old man cries.\\n     \"Upon my son, and on his ship!\"\\n\\n4. While thus with pious heart he prays,\\n     Far in the distance sounds a boom:\\n   He pauses; and again there rings\\n     That sullen thunder through the room.\\n   A ship upon the shoals to-night!\\n     She cannot hold for one half hour;\\n   But clear the ropes and grappling hooks,\\n     And trust in the Almighty Power!\\n\\n5. On the drenched gallery he stands,\\n     Striving to pierce the solid night:\\n   Across the sea the red eye throws\\n     A steady crimson wake of light;\\n   And, where it falls upon the waves,\\n     He sees a human head float by,\\n   With long drenched curls of chestnut hair,\\n     And wild but fearless hazel eye.\\n\\n6. Out with the hooks! One mighty fling!\\n     Adown the wind the long rope curls.\\n   Oh! will it catch? Ah, dread suspense!\\n     While the wild ocean wilder whirls.\\n   A steady pull; it tightens now:\\n     Oh! his old heart will burst with joy,\\n   As on the slippery rocks he pulls\\n     The breathing body of his boy.\\n\\n7. Still sweep the specters through the sky;\\n     Still scud the clouds before the storm;\\n   Still naked in the howling night\\n     The red-eyed lighthouse lifts its form.\\n   Without, the world is wild with rage;\\n     Unkenneled demons are abroad;\\n   But with the father and the son\\n     Within, there is the peace of God.\\n\\nNOTE.--Minot\\'s Ledge (also called the \"Cohasset Rocks\") is a dangerous\\nreef in Boston Harbor, eight miles southwest of Boston Light. It has a\\nfixed light of its own, sixty-six feet high.\\n\\n\\n\\nCIX. HAMLET.\\n\\nWilliam Shakespeare (b. 1564, d. 1616), by many regarded as the greatest\\npoet the world has ever produced, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon,\\nEngland. He was married, when very young, to a woman eight years his\\nsenior, went to London, was joint proprietor of Blackfriar\\'s Theater in\\n1589, wrote poems and plays, was an actor, accumulated some property, and\\nretired to Stratford three or four years before his death. He was buried\\nin Stratford church, where a monument has been erected to his memory. This\\nis all that is known of him with any degree of certainty.\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. They show a\\nwonderful knowledge of human nature, expressed in language remarkable for\\nits point and beauty.\\n\\n(ACT I, SCENE II. HAMLET alone in a room, of the castle.\\nEnter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.)\\n\\nHor. Hail, to your lordship!\\n\\nHam.                         I am glad to see you well:\\n     Horatio,--or I do forgot myself.\\n\\nHor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\\n\\nHam. Sir, my good friend; I\\'ll change that name with you:\\n     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--\\n     Macellus?\\n\\nMar.             My good lord--\\n\\nHam. I am very glad to see you. [To Ber.] Good even, sir.\\n     But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\\n\\nHor. A truant disposition, good my lord.\\n\\nHam. I would not hear your enemy say so,\\n     Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,\\n     To make it truster of your own report\\n     Against yourself: I knew you are no truant.\\n     But what is your affair in Elsinore?\\n     We\\'ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\\n\\nHor. My lord, I came to see your father\\'s funeral.\\n\\nHam. I pray thee, do not mock me, follow-student;\\n     I think it was to see my mother\\'s wedding.\\n\\nHor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.\\n\\nHam. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats\\n     Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\\n     Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven\\n     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!\\n     My father!--methinks I see my father.\\n\\nHor. Where, my lord?\\n\\nHam.    In my mind\\'s eye, Horatio.\\n\\nHor. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.\\n\\nHam. He was a man, take him for all in all,\\n     I shall not look upon his like again.\\n\\nHor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\\n\\nHam. Saw? who?\\n\\nHor. My lord, the king your father.\\n\\nHam.    The king my father!\\n\\nHor. Season your admiration for a while\\n     With an attent ear, till I may deliver,\\n     Upon the witness of these gentlemen,\\n     This marvel to you.\\n\\nHam.    For God\\'s love, let me hear.\\n\\nHor. Two nights together had these gentlemen,\\n     Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,\\n     In the dead vast and middle of the night,\\n     Been thus encounter\\'d. A figure like your father,\\n     Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie.\\n     Appears before them, and with solemn march\\n     Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk\\'d\\n     By their oppress\\'d and fear-surprised eyes,\\n     Within his trucheon\\'s length; whilst they, distill\\'d\\n     Almost to jelly with the act of fear,\\n     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\\n     In dreadful secrecy impart they did;\\n     And I with them the third night kept the watch:\\n     Where, as they had deliver\\'d, both in time,\\n     Form of the thing, each word made true and good,\\n     The apparition comes: I knew your father;\\n     These hands are not more like.\\n\\nHam.                    But where was this?\\n\\nMar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch\\'d.\\n\\nHam. Did you speak to it?\\n\\nHor.                    My lord, I did;\\n     But answer made it none: yet once methought\\n     It lifted up its head and did address\\n     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;\\n     But even then the morning cock crew loud,\\n     And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\\n     And vanish\\'d from our sight.\\n\\nHam.                    \\'T is very strange.\\n\\nHor. As I do live, my honor\\'d lord, \\'t is true;\\n     And we did think it writ down in our duty\\n     To let you know of it.\\n\\nHam. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me,\\n     Hold you the watch to-night?\\n\\nMar. Ber.                We do, my lord.\\n\\nHam. Arm\\'d, say you?\\n\\nMar.  Ber. Arm\\'d, my lord.\\n\\nHam. From top to toe?\\n\\nMar. Ber.               My lord, from head to foot.\\n\\nHam. Then saw you not his face?\\n\\nHor. Oh, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.\\n\\nHam. What, look\\'d he frowningly?\\n\\nHor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\\n\\nHam. Pale or red?\\n\\nHor. Nay, very pale.\\n\\nHam.                    And fix\\'d his eyes upon you?\\n\\nHor. Most constantly.\\n\\nHam.                    I would I had been there.\\n\\nHor. It would have much amazed you.\\n\\nHam. Very like, very like. Stay\\'d it long?\\n\\nHor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\\n\\nMar. Ber.  Longer, longer.\\n\\nHor. Not when I saw\\'t.\\n\\nHam.                    His beard was grizzled,--no?\\n\\nHor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,\\n     A sable silver\\'d.\\n\\nHam.                    I will watch to-night;\\n     Perchance \\'t will walk again.\\n\\nHor.                    I warrant it will.\\n\\nHam.

DISSERTATION ON ROAST PIG.\\n\\nCharles Lamb (b. 1775, d. 1834) was born in London. He was educated at\\nChrist\\'s Hospital, where he was a schoolfellow and intimate friend of\\nColeridge. In 1792 he became a clerk in the India House, London, and in\\n1825 he retired from his clerkship on a pension of 441 Pounds. Lamb never\\nmarried, but devoted his life to the care of his sister Mary, who was at\\ntimes insane. He wrote \"Tales founded on the Plays of Shakespeare,\" and\\nseveral other works of rare merit; but his literary fame rests principally\\non the inimitable \"Essays of Elia\" (published originally in the \"London\\nMagazine\"), from one of which the following selection is adapted.\\n\\n1. Mankind, says a Chinese manuscript, which my friend M. was obliging\\nenough to read and explain to me, for the first seventy thousand ages ate\\ntheir meat raw, clawing or biting it from the living animal, just as they\\ndo in Abyssinia to this day.\\n\\n2. This period is not obscurely hinted at by their great Confucius in the\\nsecond chapter of his \"Mundane Mutations,\" where he designates a kind of\\ngolden age by the term Cho-fang, literally the Cooks\\' Holiday. The\\nmanuscript goes on to say that the art of roasting, or rather broiling\\n(which I take to be the elder brother), was accidentally discovered in the\\nmanner following:\\n\\n3. The swineherd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the woods one morning, as\\nhis manner was, to collect mast for his hogs, left his cottage in the care\\nof his eldest son, Bo-bo, a great lubberly boy, who, being fond of playing\\nwith fire, as younkers of his age commonly are, let some sparks escape\\ninto a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly, spread the conflagration\\nover every part of their poor mansion till it was reduced to ashes.\\n\\n4. Together with the cottage,--a sorry, antediluvian makeshift of a\\nbuilding, you may think it,--what was of much more importance, a fine\\nlitter of newborn pigs, no less than nine in number, perished. China pigs\\nhave been esteemed a luxury all over the East from the remotest periods we\\nread of.\\n\\n5. Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may think, not so much\\nfor the sake of the tenement, which his father and he could easily build\\nup again with a few dry branches, and the labor of an hour or two, at any\\ntime, as for the loss of the pigs. While he was thinking what he should\\nsay to his father, and wringing his hands over the smoking remnants of one\\nof those untimely sufferers, an odor assailed his nostrils unlike any\\nscent which he had before experienced.\\n\\n6. What, could it proceed from? Not from the burnt cottage,--he had smelt\\nthat smell before,--indeed, this was by no means the first accident of the\\nkind which had occurred through the negligence of this unlucky young\\nfirebrand. Much less did it resemble that of any known herb, weed, or\\nflower. A premonitory moistening at the same time overflowed his nether\\nlip. He knew not what to think.\\n\\n7. He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were any signs of life\\nin it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them he applied them in his booby\\nfashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin had come\\naway with his fingers, and for the first time in his life (in the world\\'s\\nlife, indeed, for before him no man had known it) he tasted--crackling!\\nAgain he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much now;\\nstill he licked his fingers from a sort of habit.\\n\\n8. The truth at length broke into his slow understanding that it was the\\npig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so delicious; and surrendering\\nhimself up to the newborn pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls\\nof the scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down his\\nthroat in his beastly fashion, when his sire entered amid the smoking\\nrafters, armed with a retributory cudgel, and, finding how affairs stood,\\nbegan to rain blows upon the young rogue\\'s shoulders as thick as\\nhailstones, which Bo-bo heeded not any more than if they had been flies.\\n\\n9. His father might lay on, but he could not beat him from his pig till he\\nhad fairly made an end of it, when, becoming a little more sensible of his\\nsituation, something like the following dialogue eusued:\\n\\n\"You graceless whelp, what have you got there devouring? Is it not enough\\nthat you have burnt me down three houses with your dog\\'s tricks, and be\\nhanged to you! but you must be eating fire, and I know not what? What have\\nyou got there, I say?\"\\n\\n\"O father, the pig, the pig! do come and taste how nice the burnt pig\\neats!\"\\n\\n10. The ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed his son, and he\\ncursed himself that he should ever have a son that should eat burnt pig.\\n\\nBo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since morning, soon raked out\\nanother pig, and, fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser half by\\nmain force into the fists of Ho-ti, still shouting out, \"Eat, eat, eat the\\nburnt pig, father! only taste! Oh!\" with such like barbarous ejaculations,\\ncramming all the while as if he would choke.\\n\\n11. Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the abominable thing,\\nwavering whether he should not put his son to death for an unnatural young\\nmonster, when the crackling scorching his fingers, as it had done his\\nson\\'s, and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn tasted some of\\nits flavor, which, make what sour mouths he would for a pretense, proved\\nnot altogether displeasing to him. In conclusion (for the manuscript here\\nis a little tedious), both father and son fairly sat down to the mess, and\\nnever left off till they had dispatched all that remained of the litter.\\n\\n12. Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to let the secret escape, for the\\nneighbors would certainly have stoned them for a couple of abominable\\nwretches, who could think of improving upon the good meat which God had\\nsent them. Nevertheless strange stories got about. It was observed that\\nHo-ti\\'s cottage was burnt down now more frequently than ever. Nothing but\\nfires from this time forward. Some would break out in broad day, others in\\nthe night-time; and Ho-ti himself, which was the more remarkable, instead\\nof chastising his son, seemed to grow more indulgent to him than ever.\\n\\n13. At length they were watched, the terrible mystery discovered, and\\nfather and son summoned to take their trial at Pekin, then an\\ninconsiderable assize town. Evidence was given, the obnoxious food itself\\nproduced in court, and verdict about to be pronounced, when the foreman of\\nthe jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of which the culprits stood\\naccused, might be handed into the box.\\n\\n14. He handled it, and they all handled it; and burning their fingers, as\\nBo-bo and his father had done before them, and nature prompting to each of\\nthem the same remedy, against the face of all the facts, and the clearest\\ncharge which the judge had ever given,--to the surprise of the whole\\ncourt, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, and all present,--without leaving\\nthe box, or any manner of consultation whatever, they brought in a\\nsimultaneous verdict of \"Not Guilty.\"\\n\\n15. The judge, who was a shrewd fellow, winked at the manifest iniquity of\\nthe decision; and when the court was dismissed, went privily, and bought\\nup all the pigs that could be had for love or money. In a few days his\\nlordship\\'s townhouse was observed to be on fire.\\n\\n16. The thing took wing, and now there was nothing to be seen but fire in\\nevery direction. Fuel and pigs grew enormously dear all over the district.\\nThe insurance offices one and all shut up shop. People built slighter and\\nslighter every day, until it was feared that the very science of\\narchitecture would in no long time be lost to the world.\\n\\n17. Thus this custom of firing houses continued till in process of time,\\nsays my manuscript, a sage arose, like our Locke, who made a discovery\\nthat the flesh of swine, or indeed of any other animal, might be cooked\\n(burnt, as they called it) without the necessity of consuming a whole\\nhouse to dress it.\\n\\n18. Then first began the rude form of a gridiron. Roasting by the string\\nor spit came in a century or two later; I forget in whose dynasty. By such\\nslow degrees, concludes the manuscript, do the most useful, and seemingly\\nthe most obvious, arts make their way among mankind.\\n\\n19. Without placing too implicit faith in the account above given, it must\\nbe agreed that if a worthy pretext for so dangerous an experiment as\\nsetting houses on fire (especially in these days) could be assigned in\\nfavor of any culinary object that pretext and excuse might be found in\\nRoast Pig.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--3.

Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was one of the most illustrious of English\\nphilosophers.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXI. A PEN PICTURE.\\n\\nWilliam Black (b. 1841,---) is one of the leading modern novelist of\\nEngland. The scenes of his stories are for the most part laid in Scotland,\\nand he excels in the delineation of Scotch character. But his most\\nremarkable power is seen in those vivid, poetical descriptions of scenery,\\nof which the following selection, adapted from \"The Princess of Thule,\" is\\na good example. Mr. Black\\'s most noted works, in addition to the one\\nnamed, are: \"A Daughter of Heth,\" \"The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton,\"\\n\"Kilmeny,\" and \"McLeod of Dare.\"\\n\\n1. Lavender had already transformed Sheila into a heroine during the half\\nhour of their stroll from the beach and around the house; and as they sat\\nat dinner on this still, brilliant evening in summer, he clothed her in\\nthe garments of romance.\\n\\n2. Her father, with his great, gray beard and heavy brow, became the King\\nof Thule, living in this solitary house overlooking the sea, and having\\nmemories of a dear sweetheart. His daughter, the Princess, had the glamour\\nof a thousand legends dwelling in her beautiful eyes; and when she walked\\nby the shores of the Atlantic, that were now getting yellow under the\\nsunset, what strange and unutterable thoughts must appear in the wonder of\\nher face!\\n\\n3. After dinner they went outside and sat down on a bench in the garden.\\nIt was a cool and pleasant evening. The sun had gone down in red fire\\nbehind the Atlantic, and there was still left a rich glow of crimson in\\nthe west, while overhead, in the pale yellow of the sky, some filmy clouds\\nof rose color lay motionless. How calm was the sea out there, and the\\nwhiter stretch of water coming into Loch Roag! The cool air of the\\ntwilight was scented with sweetbrier. The wash of the ripples along the\\ncoast could be heard in the stillness.\\n\\n4. The girl put her hand on her father\\'s head, and reminded him that she\\nhad had her big greyhound, Bras, imprisoned all the afternoon, and that\\nshe had to go down to Borvabost with a message for some people who were\\nleaving by the boat in the morning.\\n\\n\"But you can not go away down to Borvabost by yourself, Sheila,\" said\\nIngram. \"It will be dark before you return.\"\\n\\n\"It will not be darker than this all the night through,\" said the girl.\\n\\n5. \"But I hope you will let us go with you,\" said Lavender, rather\\nanxiously; and she assented with a gracious smile, and went to fetch the\\ngreat deerhound that was her constant companion. And lo! he found himself\\nwalking with a Princess in this wonderland, through the magic twilight\\nthat prevails in northern latitudes. Mackenzie and Ingram had gone to the\\nfront. The large deerhound, after regarding him attentively, had gone to\\nits mistress\\'s side, and remained closely there.\\n\\n6. Even Sheila, when they had reached the loftiest part of their route,\\nand could see beneath them the island and the water surrounding it, was\\nstruck by the exceeding beauty of the twilight; and as for her companion,\\nhe remembered it many a time thereafter, as if it were a dream of the sea.\\n\\n\\n7. Before them lay the Atlantic--a pale line of blue, still, silent, and\\nremote. Overhead the sky was of a clear, thin gold, with heavy masses of\\nviolet cloud stretched across from north to south, and thickening as they\\ngot near the horizon. Down at their feet, near the shore, a dusky line of\\nhuts and houses was scarcely visible; and over these lay a pale blue film\\nof peat smoke that did not move in the still air.\\n\\n8. Then they saw the bay into which the White Water runs, and they could\\ntrace the yellow glimmer of the river stretching into the island through a\\nlevel valley of bog and morass. Far away towards the east lay the bulk of\\nthe island,--dark green undulations of moorland and pasture; and there, in\\nthe darkness, the gable of one white house had caught the clear light of\\nthe sky, and was gleaming westward like a star.\\n\\n9. But all this was as nothing to the glory that began to shine in the\\nsoutheast, where the sky was of a pale violet over the peaks of\\nMealasabhal and Suainabhal. There, into the beautiful dome, rose the\\ngolden crescent of the moon, warm in color, as though it still retained\\nthe last rays of the sunset. A line of quivering gold fell across Loch\\nRoag, and touched the black hull and spars of the boat in which Sheila had\\nbeen sailing in the morning.\\n\\n10. That bay down there, with its white sands and massive rocks, its still\\nexpanse of water, and its background of mountain peaks palely covered by\\nthe yellow moonlight, seemed really a home for a magic princess who was\\nshut off from all the world. But here, in front of them, was another sort\\nof sea, and another sort of life,--a small fishing village hidden under a\\ncloud of pale peat smoke, and fronting the great waters of the Atlantic\\nitself, which lay under a gloom of violet clouds.\\n\\n11. On the way home it was again Lavender\\'s good fortune to walk with\\nSheila across the moorland path they had traversed some little time\\nbefore. And now the moon was still higher in the heavens, and the yellow\\nlane of light that crossed the violet waters of Loch Roag quivered in a\\ndeeper gold. The night air was scented with the Dutch clover growing down\\nby the shore. They could hear the curlew whistling and the plover calling\\namid that monotonous plash of the waves that murmured all around the\\ncoast.\\n\\n12. When they returned to the house, the darker waters of the Atlantic and\\nthe purple clouds of the west were shut out from sight; and before them\\nthere was only the liquid plain of Loch Roag, with its pathway of yellow\\nfire, and far away on the other side the shoulders and peaks of the\\nsouthern mountains, that had grown gray and clear and sharp in the\\nbeautiful twilight. And this was Sheila\\'s home.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Gla\\'mour (pro. gla\\'moor), witchery, or a charm on the\\neyes, making them see things differently from what they really are. 3.\\nLoch (pro. lok), a lake, a bay or arm of the sea. 7.

Brooks (b. 1813, d. 1833)[1] was born at Salem, Mass., and was\\nthe valedictorian of his class at Harvard College, where he graduated in\\n1832. He shortly afterwards entered the ministry, and had charge of a\\ncongregation at Newport, R.I. He was a great student of German literature,\\nand began his own literary career by a translations of Schiller\\'s \"William\\nTell.\" This was followed by numerous translations from the German, mainly\\npoetry, which have been published from time to time, in several volumes.\\nOf these translations, Goethe\\'s \"Faust,\" Richter\\'s \"Titan\" and \"Hesperus,\"\\nand a humorous poem by Dr. Karl Arnold Kortum, \"The Life, Opinions,\\nActions, and Fate of Hieronimus Jobs, the Candidate,\" deserve especial\\nmention.

A PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE.\\n\\nSamuel Johnson (b. 1709, d. 1784). This remarkable man was born in\\nLichfield, Staffordshire, England. He was the son of a bookseller and\\nstationer. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but his poverty\\ncompelled him to leave at the end of three years. Soon after his marriage,\\nin 1736, he opened a private school, but obtained only three pupils, one\\nof whom was David Garrick, afterwards a celebrated actor. In 1737, he\\nremoved to London, where he resided most of the rest of his life. The most\\nnoted of his numerous literary works are his \"Dictionary,\" the first one\\nof the English language worthy of mention, \"The Vanity of Human Wishes,\" a\\npoem, \"The Rambler,\" \"Rasselas,\" \"The Lives of the English Poets,\" and his\\nedition of Shakespeare. An annual pension of 300 pounds was granted him in\\n1762.\\n\\nIn person, Johnson was heavy and awkward; in manner, boorish and\\noverbearing; but his learning and his great powers caused his company to\\nbe sought by many eminent men.\\n\\n1. Obidah, the son of Abnesina, left the caravansary early in the morning,\\nand pursued his journey through the plains of Hindostan. He was fresh and\\nvigorous with rest; he was animated with hope; he was incited by desire;\\nhe walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw the hills gradually\\nrising before him.\\n\\n2. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the morning song of\\nthe bird of paradise; he was fanned by the last flutters of the sinking\\nbreeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices; he sometimes\\ncontemplated towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and\\nsometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter of\\nthe spring; all his senses were gratified, and all care was banished from\\nhis heart.\\n\\n3. Thus he went on, till the sun approached his meridian, and the\\nincreasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked round about him\\nfor some more commodious path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that\\nseemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and\\nfound the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant. He did not, however,\\nforget whither he was traveling, but found a narrow way, bordered with\\nflowers, which appeared to have the same direction with the main road, and\\nwas pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite\\npleasure with business, and to gain the rewards of diligence without\\nsuffering its fatigues.\\n\\n4. He, therefore, still continued to walk for a time, without the least\\nremission of his ardor, except that he was sometimes tempted to stop by\\nthe music of the birds, which the heat had assembled in the shade, and\\nsometimes amused himself with picking the flowers that covered the banks\\non each side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At last, the\\ngreen path began to decline from its first tendency, and to wind among the\\nhills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls.\\n\\n5. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether it was\\nlonger safe to forsake the known and common track; but, remembering that\\nthe heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty\\nand uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed only to\\nmake a few meanders, in compliance with the garieties of the ground, and\\nto end at last in the common road.\\n\\n6. Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace, though he\\nsuspected he was not gaining ground. This uneasiness of his mind inclined\\nhim to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every sensation that\\nmight soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo, he mounted every\\nhill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside to every cascade, and pleased\\nhimself with tracing the course of a gentle river that rolled among the\\ntrees, and watered a large region, with innumerable circumvolutions.\\n\\n7. In these amusements, the hours passed away uncounted; his deviations\\nhad perplexed his memory, and he knew not toward what point to travel. He\\nstood pensive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong,\\nyet conscious that the time of loitering was now past. While he was thus\\ntortured with uncertainty, the sky was overspread with clouds, the day\\nvanished from before him, and a sudden tempest gathered round his head.\\n\\n8. He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of\\nhis folly; he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he\\nlamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the\\ngrove, and despised the petty curiosity that led him on from trifle to\\ntrifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker and a clap of\\nthunder broke his meditation.\\n\\n9. He now resolved to do what remained yet in his power; to tread back the\\nground which he had passed, and try to find some issue where the wood\\nmight open into the plain. He prostrated himself upon the ground, and\\ncommended his life to the Lord of nature. He rose with confidence and\\ntranquillity, and pressed on with his saber in his hand; for the beasts of\\nthe desert were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls\\nof rage, and fear, and ravage, and expiration; all the horrors of darkness\\nand solitude surrounded him; the winds roared in the woods, and the\\ntorrents tumbled from the hills.\\n\\n10. Thus, forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the wild without\\nknowing whither he was going or whether he was every moment drawing nearer\\nto safety or to destruction. At length, not fear but labor began to\\novercome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled, and he was on\\nthe point of lying down, in resignation to his fate, when he beheld,\\nthrough the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced toward the\\nlight, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he\\ncalled humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before\\nhim such provisions as he had collected for himself, on which Obidah fed\\nwith eagerness and gratitude.\\n\\n11. When the repast was over, \"Tell me,\" said the hermit, \"by what chance\\nthou hast been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant\\nof this wilderness, in which I never saw a man before.\" Obidah then\\nrelated the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or\\npalliation.\\n\\n12. \"Son,\" said the hermit, \"let the errors and follies, the dangers and\\nescapes, of this day, sink deep into your heart. Remember, my son, that\\nhuman life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of youth, full\\nof vigor, and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope,\\nwith gayety and with diligence, and travel on awhile in the straight road\\nof piety toward the mansions of rest. In a short time we remit our fervor,\\nand endeavor to find some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy means\\nof obtaining the same end.\\n\\n13. \"We then relax our vigor, and resolve no longer to be terrified with\\ncrimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constancy, and venture to\\napproach what we resolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ease,\\nand repose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and\\nvigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire whether another advance\\ncan not be made, and whether we may not at least turn our eyes upon the\\ngardens of pleasure. We approach them with scruple and hesitation; we\\nenter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pass\\nthrough them without losing the road of virtue, which we for a while keep\\nin our sight, and to which we propose to return.\\n\\n14. \"But temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us\\nfor another; we, in time, lose the happiness of innocence, and solace our\\ndisquiet with sensual gratifications. By degrees we let fall the\\nremembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object\\nof rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge ourselves\\nin luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconstancy till the\\ndarkness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct\\nour way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, and\\nwith repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we had not\\nforsaken the paths of virtue.\\n\\n15. \"Happy are they, my son, who shall learn, from thy example, not to\\ndespair, but shall remember that though the day is past, and their\\nstrength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that\\nreformation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavors ever unassisted; that\\nthe wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he who\\nimplores strength and courage from above, shall find danger and difficulty\\ngive way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose: commit thyself to the\\ncare of Omnipotence; and when the morning calls again to toil, begin anew\\nthy journey and thy life.\"\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

A SUMMER LONGING.\\n\\nGeorge Arnold (b. 1834, d. 1865) was born in New York, but removed with\\nhis parents to Illinois while yet an infant. There he passed his boyhood,\\nbeing educated at home by his parents. In 1849 the family again removed to\\nStrawberry Farms, Monmouth County, N.J. When eighteen years old he began\\nto study painting, but soon gave up the art and devoted himself to\\nliterature. He became a journalist of New York City, and his productions\\ninclude almost every variety of writings found in the literary magazines.\\nAfter his death, two volumes of his poems, \"Drift: a Seashore Idyl,\" and\\n\"Poems, Grave and Gay,\" were edited by Mr. William Winter.\\n\\n1. I must away to the wooded hills and vales,\\n     Where broad, slow streams flow cool and silently\\n   And idle barges flap their listless sails.\\n   For me the summer sunset glows and pales,\\n     And green fields wait for me.\\n\\n2. I long for shadowy founts, where the birds\\n     Twitter and chirp at noon from every tree;\\n   I long for blossomed leaves and lowing herds;\\n   And Nature\\'s voices say in mystic words,\\n     \"The green fields wait for thee.\"\\n\\n3. I dream of uplands, where the primrose shines\\n     And waves her yellow lamps above the lea;\\n   Of tangled copses, swung with trailing vines;\\n   Of open vistas, skirted with tall pines,\\n     Where green fields wait for me.\\n\\n4. I think of long, sweet afternoons, when I\\n     May lie and listen to the distant sea,\\n   Or hear the breezes in the reeds that sigh,\\n   Or insect voices chirping shrill and dry,\\n     In fields that wait for me.\\n\\n5. These dreams of summer come to bid me find\\n     The forest\\'s shade, the wild bird\\'s melody,\\n   While summer\\'s rosy wreaths for me are twined,\\n   While summer\\'s fragrance lingers on the wind,\\n     And green fields wait for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXV. FATE.\\n\\nFrancis Bret Harte (b. 1839,--) was born in Albany, N.Y. When seventeen\\nyears old he went to California, where he engaged in various employments.\\nHe was a teacher, was employed in government offices, worked in the gold\\nmines, and learned to be a compositor in a printing office. In 1868 he\\nstarted the \"Overland Monthly,\" and his original and characteristic poems\\nand sketches soon made it a popular magazine. Mr. Harte has been a\\ncontributor to some of the leading periodicals of the country, but\\nprincipally to the \"Atlantic Monthly.\"\\n\\n1. \"The sky is clouded, the rocks are bare;\\n   The spray of the tempest is white in air;\\n   The winds are out with the waves at play,\\n   And I shall not tempt the sea to-day.\\n\\n2. \"The trail is narrow, the wood is dim,\\n   The panther clings to the arching limb;\\n   And the lion\\'s whelps are abroad at play,\\n   And I shall not join in the chase to-day.\"\\n\\n3. But the ship sailed safely over the sea,\\n   And the hunters came from the chase in glee;\\n   And the town that was builded upon a rock\\n   Was swallowed up in the earthquake shock.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXVI. THE BIBLE THE BEST OF CLASSICS.\\n\\nThomas S. Grimke (b. 1786, d. 1834). This eminent lawyer and\\nscholar was born in Charleston, S.C. He graduated at Yale College\\nin 1807. He gained considerable reputation as a politician, but is\\nbest known as an advocate of peace, Sunday schools, and the\\nBible. He was a man of deep feeling, earnest purpose, and pure\\nlife.\\n\\n1. There is a classic the best the world has ever seen, the noblest that\\nhas ever honored and dignified the language of mortals. If we look into\\nits antiquity, we discover a title to our veneration unrivaled in the\\nhistory of literature. If we have respect to its evidences, they are found\\nin the testimony of miracle and prophecy; in the ministry of man, of\\nnature, and of angels, yea, even of \"God, manifest in the flesh,\" of \"God\\nblessed forever.\"\\n\\n2. If we consider its authenticity, no other pages have survived the lapse\\nof time that can be compared with it. If we examine its authority, for it\\nspeaks as never man spake, we discover that it came from heaven in vision\\nand prophecy under the sanction of Him who is Creator of all things, and\\nthe Giver of every good and perfect gift.\\n\\n3. If we reflect on its truths, they are lovely and spotless, sublime and\\nholy as God himself, unchangeable as his nature, durable as his righteous\\ndominion, and versatile as the moral condition of mankind. If we regard\\nthe value of its treasures, we must estimate them, not like the relics of\\nclassic antiquity, by the perishable glory and beauty, virtue and\\nhappiness, of this world, but by the enduring perfection and supreme\\nfelicity of an eternal kingdom.\\n\\n4. If we inquire who are the men that have recorded its truths, vindicated\\nits rights, and illustrated the excellence of its scheme, from the depth\\nof ages and from the living world, from the populous continent and the\\nisles of the sea, comes forth the answer: \"The patriarch and the prophet,\\nthe evangelist and the martyr.\"\\n\\n5. If we look abroad through the world of men, the victims of folly or\\nvice, the prey of cruelty, of injustice, and inquire what are its\\nbenefits, even in this temporal state, the great and the humble, the rich\\nand the poor, the powerful and the weak, the learned and the ignorant\\nreply, as with one voice, that humility and resignation, purity, order,\\nand peace, faith, hope, and charity are its blessings upon earth.\\n\\n6. And if, raising our eyes from time to eternity; from the world of\\nmortals to the world of just men made perfect; from the visible creation,\\nmarvelous, beautiful, and glorious as it is, to the invisible creation of\\nangels and seraphs; from the footstool of God to the throne of God\\nhimself, we ask, what are the blessings that flow from this single volume,\\nlet the question be answered by the pen of the evangelist, the harp of the\\nprophet, and the records of the book of life.\\n\\n7. Such is the best of classics the world has ever admired; such, the\\nnoblest that man has ever adopted as a guide.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Clas\\'sic, a work of acknowledged excellence and\\nauthority. 2. Au-then-tic\\'i-ty, of established authority for truth and\\ncorrectness. Sanc\\'tion (pro, sank\\'shun), authority, support. 3.\\nVer\\'sa-tile, readily applied to various subjects. 4. Vin di-cat-ed,\\ndefended, justified. E-van\\'gel-ist, a writer of the history of Jesus\\nChrist. 6. Ser\\'aph, an angel of the highest order.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXVII. MY MOTHER\\'S BIBLE.\\n\\nGeorge P. Morris (b. 1802, d. 1864) was born in Philadelphia. In 1823 he\\nbecame one of the editors of the \"New York Mirror,\" a weekly literary\\npaper, In 1846 Mr. Morris and N. P. Willis founded \"The Home Journal.\" He\\nwas associate editor of this popular journal until a short time before his\\ndeath.\\n\\n1. This book is all that\\'s left me now,--\\n     Tears will unbidden start,--\\n   With faltering lip and throbbing brow\\n     I press it to my heart.\\n   For many generations past\\n     Here is our family tree;\\n   My mother\\'s hands this Bible clasped,\\n     She, dying, gave it me.\\n\\n2. Ah! well do I remember those\\n     Whose names these records bear;\\n   Who round the hearthstone used to close,\\n     After the evening prayer,\\n   And speak of what these pages said\\n     In tones my heart would thrill!\\n   Though they are with the silent dead,\\n     Here are they living still!\\n\\n3. My father read this holy hook\\n     To brothers, sisters, dear;\\n   How calm was my poor mother\\'s look,\\n     Who loved God\\'s word to hear!\\n   Her angel face,--I see it yet!\\n     What thronging memories come!\\n   Again that little group is met\\n     Within the walls of home!\\n\\n4. Thou truest friend man ever knew,\\n     Thy constancy I\\'ve tried;\\n   When all were false, I found thee true,\\n     My counselor and guide.\\n   The mines of earth no treasures give\\n     That could this volume buy;\\n   In teaching me the way to live,\\n     It taught me how to die.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of McGuffey\\'s Fifth Eclectic Reader\\nby William Holmes McGuffey\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MCGUFFEY\\'S FIFTH ECLECTIC READER ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 15040.txt or 15040.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/0/4/15040/\\n\\nProduced by Don Kostuch\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"

At the same\\ntime, the books have been enlarged; old pieces have been exchanged for new\\nwherever the advantage was manifest; and several new features have been\\nincorporated, which it is thought will add largely to the value of the\\nseries.\\n\\nIn the revision of the SIXTH READER, the introductory matter has been\\nretained with but little change, and it will he found very valuable for\\nelocutionary drill. In the preparation of this portion of the work, free\\nuse was made of the writings of standard authors upon Elocution, such as\\nWalker, McCulloch, Sheridan Knowles, Ewing, Pinnock, Scott, Bell, Graham,\\nMylins, Wood, Rush, and many others.\\n\\nIn making up the Selections for Reading, great care and deliberation have\\nbeen exercised. The best pieces of the old book are retained in the\\nREVISED SIXTH, and to the these been added a long list of selections from\\nthe best English and American literature. Upwards of one hundred leading\\nauthors are represented (see \"Alphabetical List. of Authors,\" page ix),\\nand thus a wide range of specimens of the best style has been secured.\\nClose scrutiny revealed the fact that many popular selections common to\\nseveral series of Readers, had been largely adapted, but in McGUFFEY\\'S\\nREVISED READERS, wherever it was possible to do so, the selections have\\nbeen compared, and made to conform strictly with the originals as they\\nappear in the latest editions authorized by the several writers.\\n\\nThe character of the selections, aside from their elocutionary value, has\\nalso been duly considered. It will be found, upon examination, that they\\npresent the same instructive merit and healthful moral tone which gave the\\npreceding edition its high reputation.\\n\\nTwo new features of the REVISED SIXTH deserve especial attention--the\\nexplanatory notes, and the biographical notices of authors. The first, in\\nthe absence of a large number of books of reference, are absolutely\\nnecessary, in some cases, for the intelligent reading of the piece; and it\\nis believed that in all cases they will add largely to the interest and\\nusefulness of the lessons.\\n\\nThe biographical notices, if properly used, are hardly of less value than\\nthe lessons themselves. They have been carefully prepared, and are\\nintended not only to add to the interest of the pieces, but to supply\\ninformation usually obtained only by the separate study of English and\\nAmerican literature.\\n\\nThe illustrations of the REVISED SIXTH READER are presented as specimens\\nof fine art. They are the work of the best artists and engravers that\\ncould be secured for the purpose in this country. The names of these\\ngentlemen may be found on page ten.\\n\\nThe publishers would here repeat their acknowledgments to the numerous\\nfriends and critics who have kindly assisted in the work of revision, and\\nwould mention particularly President EDWIN C. HEWETT, of the State Normal\\nUniversity, Normal, Illinois, and the HON. THOMAS W. HARVEY, of\\nPainesville, Ohio, who have had the revision of the SIXTH READER under\\ntheir direct advice.\\n\\nEspecial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co., for\\ntheir permission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions\\nof many of the foremost American authors whose works they publish.\\nJanuary, 1880.\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS (5)\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\n\\nSUBJECT.

(11)\\n\\n\\nThe subject of Elocution, so far as it is deemed applicable to a work of\\nthis kind, will be considered under the following heads, viz:\\n\\n\\n1. ARTICULATION.           4. READING VERSE.\\n2. INFLECTION.             5. THE VOICE.\\n3. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.    6. GESTURE.\\n\\n\\n\\nI. ARTICULATION. (11)\\n\\nArticulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and\\nof their combinations.\\n\\nAs words consist of one or more elementary sounds, the first object of the\\nstudent should he to acquire the power of uttering those sounds with\\ndistinctness, smoothness, and force. This result can be secured only by\\ncareful practice, which must be persevered in until the learner has\\nacquired a perfect control of his organs of speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS. (12)\\n\\nAn Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of\\nspeech.\\n\\nThe Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,\\nSubvocals, and Aspirates.\\n\\n\\n\\nVOCALS. (12)\\n\\nVocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most\\nprominent elements of all words, and it is proper that they should first\\nreceive attention. A vocal may be represented by one letter, as in the\\nword hat, or by two or more letters, as in heat, beauty. A diphthong is a\\nunion of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other. It is\\nusually represented by two letters, as in the words oil, boy, out, now.\\n\\nEach of these can he uttered with great force, so as to give a distinct\\nexpression of its sound, although the voice be suddenly suspended, the\\nmoment the sound is produced. This is done by putting the lips, teeth,\\ntongue, and palate in their proper position, and then expelling each sound\\nfrom the throat in the same manner that the syllable \"ah!\" is uttered in\\nendeavoring to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus,\\na\\'--a\\'--a\\'--.\\n\\nLet the pupil he required to utter every one of the elements in the Table\\nwith all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to do\\nit with ease and accuracy. This must not he considered as accomplished\\nuntil he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the\\nsuddenness of the crack of a rifle. Care must be taken that the vocal\\nalone be heard; there must be no consonantal sound, and no vocal sound\\nother than the one intended.\\n\\nAt first, the elementary sounds may be repeated by the class in concert;\\nthen separately.\\n\\n\\n\\nTABLE OF VOCALS. (13)\\n\\nLong Sounds.\\n\\nSound   as in\\n\\na       hate\\ne       err\\na       hare\\ni       pine\\na       pass\\no       no\\na       far\\noo      cool\\na       fall\\nu       tube\\ne       eve\\nu       burn\\n\\n\\nShort Sounds.\\n\\nSound   as in\\n\\na       mat\\no       hot\\ne       met\\noo      book\\ni       it\\nu       us\\n\\n\\nDiphthongs.\\noi, oy, as in oil, boy.\\nou, ow, as in out, now.\\n\\n\\nREMARK I.--In this table, the short sounds are nearly or quite the same,\\nin quantity, as the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in\\nquality. Let the pupil determine this fact by experiment.\\n\\nREMARK II.--The vocals are often represented by other letters or\\ncombinations of letters than those used in the table: for instance, a is\\nrepresented by ai as in hail, by ea as in steak, etc.\\n\\nREMARK III.--As  a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should\\nbe articulated with full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a\\nsharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance. Weakness of speech\\nfollows a failure to observe the first point, while drawling results from\\ncarelessness with respect to the second.\\n\\n\\n\\nSUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES (13)\\n\\nSubvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less\\nobstructed.\\n\\nAspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.\\n\\nWords ending with subvocal sounds may be selected for practice on the\\nsubvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for\\npractice on aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly,\\nseveral times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the\\nsubvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and\\nelements, at first, in concert; then separately.\\n\\n\\n\\nTABLE OF SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES. (14)\\n\\nSubvocals. as in\\n\\nb          babe\\nd          bad\\ng          nag\\nj          judge\\nv          move\\nth         with\\nz          buzz\\nz          azure (azh-)\\nw          wine\\n\\nAspirates. as in\\n\\np          rap\\nt          at\\nk          book\\nch         rich\\nf          life\\nth         smith\\ns          hiss\\nsh         rush\\nwh         what\\n\\n\\nREMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognates. In\\narticulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position\\nrequired in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the\\nbreath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal\\nsound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice\\non these cognates.\\n\\nThe following subvocals and aspirate have no cognates:\\n\\nSUBVOCAL  as in\\n\\nl         mill\\nng        sing\\nm         rim\\nr         rule\\nn         run\\ny         yet\\n\\n\\n\\nASPIRATE.\\n\\nh, as in hat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSUBSTITUTES. (14)\\n\\nSubstitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented\\nby other characters.\\n\\nTABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.\\nSub  for  as in\\n\\na    o    what\\ny    i    hymn\\ne    a    there\\nc    s    cite\\ne    a    freight\\nc    k    cap\\ni    e    police\\nch   sh   machine\\ni    e    sir\\nch   k    chord\\no    u    son\\ng    j    cage\\no    oo   to\\nn    ng   rink\\no    oo   would\\ns    z    rose\\no    a    corn\\ns    sh   sugar\\no    u    worm\\nx    gz   examine\\nu    oo   pull\\ngh   f    laugh\\nu    oo   rude\\nph   f    sylph\\ny    i    my\\nqu   k    pique\\nqu   kw   quick\\n\\n\\n\\nFAULTS TO BE REMEDIED.

INFLECTION. (18)\\n\\nInflection is a bending or sliding of the voice either upward or downward.\\n\\nThe upward or rising inflection is an upward slide of the voice, and is\\nmarked by the acute accent, thus, (\\'); as,\\n\\n   Did you call\\'? Is he sick\\'?\\n\\nThe downward or falling inflection is a downward slide of the voice, and\\nis marked by the grave accent, thus, (\\'); as,\\n\\n   Where is London\\'? Where have you been\\'?\\n\\nSometimes both the rising and falling inflections are given to the same\\nsound. Such sounds are designated by the circumflex, thus, (v) or thus,\\n(^). The former is called the rising circumflex; the latter, the falling\\ncircumflex; as,\\n\\n  But nobody can bear the death of Clodius.\\n\\nWhen several successive syllables are uttered without either the upward or\\ndownward slide, they are said to be uttered in a monotone, which is marked\\nthus, (--); as,\\n\\n  Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll\\n\\nEXAMPLES.

(21)\\n\\nRULE I.--Sentences, and parts of sentences which make complete sense in\\nthemselves, require the falling inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (21)\\n\\n1. By virtue we secure happiness\\'.\\n\\n2. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven\\': I will\\nexalt my throne above the stars of God\\':  I will sit, also, upon the mount\\nof the congregation, in the sides of the north\\'.\\n\\n3. The wind and the rain are over\\'; calm is the noon of the day\\\\: the\\nclouds are divided in heaven\\'; over the green hills flies the inconstant\\nsun\\'; red through the stormy vale comes down the stream\\'.\\n\\n4. This proposition was, however, rejected,\\' and not merely rejected, but\\nrejected with insult\\'.\\n\\nException.--Emphasis sometimes reverses this rule, and requires the rising\\ninflection, apparently for the purpose of calling attention to the idea of\\nan unusual manner of expressing it.\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (21)\\n\\n1. I should not like to ride in that car\\'.\\n2. Look out! A man was drowned there yesterday\\'.\\n3. Presumptuous man! the gods\\' take care of Cato\\',\\n\\n\\nRULE II.--The language of emphasis generally requires the falling\\ninflection.\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (22)\\n\\n1.

(22)\\n\\n1. How many books did he purchase\\'?\\n\\n2. Why reason ye these things in your hearts\\'?\\n\\n3. What see\\' you, that you frown so heavily to-day\\'?\\n\\n4. Ah! what is that flame which now bursts on his eye\\'?\\n\\n5. Whence this pleasing hope\\', this fond desire\\',\\n   This longing after immortality\\'?\\n\\n\\nException.--When questions usually requiring  the falling inflection are\\nemphatic or repeated, they take the rising inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES.

(23)\\n\\nRULE IV.--The rising inflection is generally used where the sense is\\ndependent or incomplete.\\n\\nREMARK.--This inflection is generally very slight, requiring an acute and\\neducated ear to discern it, and it is difficult to teach pupils to\\ndistinguish it, though they constantly use it. Care should be taken not to\\nexaggerate it.\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (23)\\n\\n1. Nature being exhausted\\', he quietly resigned himself to his fate.\\n\\n2. A chieftain to the Highlands bound\\',\\n   Cries\\', \"Boatman, do not tarry!\"\\n\\n3.

Brother\\', give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick!,\\n   Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.\\n\\n8. O Lancaster\\', I fear thy overthrow.\\n\\n9. Ye crags\\' and peaks\\', I\\'m with you once again.\\n\\nException 1.--Relative emphasis often reverses this and the first rule,\\nbecause emphasis is here expressed in part by changing the usual\\ninflections.\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (23)\\n\\n1. If you care not for your property\\', you surely value your life\\'.\\n\\n2. If you will not labor for your own\\' advancement, you should regard\\nthat of your children\\'.\\n\\n3. It is your place to obey\\', not to command\\'.\\n\\n4. Though by that course he should not destroy his reputation\\', he will\\nlose all self-respect\\'.\\n\\nException 2.--The names of persons addressed in a formal speech, or\\nwhen used emphatically, have the falling inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (24)\\n\\n1. Romans, countrymen, and lovers\\', hear me for my cause, etc.\\n\\n2. Gentlemen of the jury\\', I solicit your attention, etc.\\n\\n3. O Hubert\\', Hubert\\', save me from these men.\\n\\n\\nRULE V.--Negative sentences and parts of sentences, usually require\\nthe rising inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (24)\\n\\n1. It is not by starts of application that eminence can be attained\\'.\\n\\n2.

My Lord, we could not have had such designs\\'.\\n\\n5. You are not left alone to climb the steep ascent\\': God is with you, who\\nnever suffers the spirit that rests on him to fail.\\n\\n\\nException 1.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLE. (24)\\n\\nWe repeat it, we do not\\' desire to produce discord; we do not\\' wish to\\nkindle the flames of a civil war.\\n\\n\\nException 2.--General propositions and commands usually have the\\nfalling inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (25)\\n\\nGod is not the author of sin\\'. Thou shalt not kill.\\n\\nRULE VI.--Interrogative sentences, and members of sentences which\\ncan be answered by yes or no generally require the rising inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (25)\\n\\n1. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation\\'?\\n\\n2. Does the gentleman suppose it is in his power\\', to exhibit in Carolina\\na name so bright\\' as to produce envy\\' in my bosom?\\n\\n3. If it be admitted, that strict integrity is not the shortest way to\\nsuccess, is it not the surest\\', the happiest\\', the best\\'?\\n\\n4.  Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens, To wash this crimson\\nhand as white as snow\\'?\\n\\nException.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (25)\\n\\n1, Can\\' you be so blind to your interest? Will\\' you rush headlong to\\ndestruction?\\n\\n2. I ask again, is\\' there no hope of reconciliation? Must\\' we abandon all\\nour fond anticipations?\\n\\n3.  Will you deny\\' it? Will you deny\\' it?\\n\\n4. Am I Dromio\\'? Am I your man\\'?

A statesman\\'? Why, he never\\ninvented a decent humbug.\\n\\n7. I can not say, sir, which of these motives influence the advocates of\\nthe bill before us; a bill\\', in which such cruelties are proposed as are\\nyet unknown among the most savage nations.\\n\\n\\nRISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS.

Dryden\\'s page is\\na natural field, rising into inequalities, varied by exuberant\\nvegetation\\'; Pope\\'s is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe and leveled by\\nthe roller\\'.\\n\\n7. If the flights of Dryden are higher\\', Pope continues longer on the\\nwing\\'. If the blaze of Dryden\\'s fire is brighter\\', the heat of Pope\\'s is\\nmore regular and constant\\'. Dryden often surpasses\\' expectation, and Pope\\nnever falls below\\' it.\\n\\nREMARK l.--Words and members connected by or used disjunctively, generally\\nexpress contrast or antithesis, and always receive opposite inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (27)\\n\\n1. Shall we advance\\', or retreat\\'?\\n\\n2. Do you seek wealth\\', or power\\'?\\n\\n3. Is the great chain upheld by God\\', or thee\\'?\\n\\n4. Shall we return to our allegiance while we may do so with safety and\\nhonor\\', or shall we wait until the ax of the executioner is at our\\nthroats\\'?\\n\\n5. Shall we crown\\' the author of these public calamities with garlands\\',\\nor shall we wrest\\' from him his ill-deserved authority\\' ?\\n\\nREMARK 2.--When the antithesis is between affirmation and negation, the\\nlatter usually has the rising inflection, according to Rule V.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (27)\\n\\n1. You were paid to fight\\' against Philip, not to rail\\' at him.\\n\\n2. I said rationally\\', not irrationally\\'.\\n\\n3. I did not say rationally\\', but irrationally\\'.\\n\\n4.

(29)\\n\\n1. Days\\', months\\', years\\', and ages\\', shall circle away,\\n   And still the vast waters above thee shall roll.\\n\\n2. Property\\', character\\', reputation\\', everything\\', was sacrificed.\\n\\n3. Toils\\', sufferings\\', wounds\\', and death\\' was the price of our liberty.\\n\\n\\nRULE X.--All the members of a concluding series, when not at all emphatic,\\nusually require the falling inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES.

At the sacred call of country, they sacrifice property\\', ease\\',\\nhealth\\', applause\\' and even life\\'.\\n\\n3.

(30)\\n\\n1. They saw not one man\\', not one woman\\', not one child\\', not one\\nfour-footed beast\\'.\\n\\n2. His hopes\\', his happiness\\', his life\\', hung upon the words that fell\\nfrom those lips,\\n\\n3. They fought\\', they bled\\', they died\\', for freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nPARENTHESIS. (30)\\n\\nRULE XI.--A parenthesis should be read more rapidly and in a lower key\\nthan the rest of the sentence, and should terminate with the same\\ninflection that next precedes it. If, however, it is complicated, or\\nemphatic, or disconnected from the main subject, the inflections must be\\ngoverned by the same rules as in the other cases.\\n\\nREMARK.--A smooth and expressive reading of a parenthesis is difficult of\\nacquisition, and can be secured only by careful and persistent training.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (30)\\n\\n1. God is my witness\\' (whom I serve with my spirit, in the gospel of his\\nSon\\'), that, without ceasing, I make mention of you always in my prayers;\\nmaking request\\' (if, by any means, now at length, I might have a\\nprosperous journey by the will of God\\'), to come unto you.\\n\\n2. When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and laying\\nhis left hand upon his breast\\' (a slender, white staff with which he\\njourneyed being in his right\\'), he introduced himself with a little story\\nof his convent.\\n\\n3. If you, AEschines, in particular, were persuaded\\' (and it was no\\nparticular affection for me, that prompted you to give up the hopes, the\\nappliances, the honors, which attended the course I then advised; but the\\nsuperior force of truth, and your utter inability to point any course more\\neligible\\') if this was the case, I say, is it not highly cruel and unjust\\nto arraign these measures now, when you could not then propose a better?\\n\\n4. As the hour of conflict drew near\\' (and this was a conflict to be\\ndreaded even by him\\'), he began to waver, and to abate much of his\\nboasting.\\n\\n\\n\\nCIRCUMFLEX. (31)\\n\\nRULE XII.--The circumflex is used to express irony, sarcasm, hypothesis,\\nor contrast.\\n\\nNOTE.--For the reason that the circumflex always suggests a double or\\ndoubtful meaning, it is appropriate for the purposes expressed in the\\nrule. It is, also, frequently used in sportive language; jokes and puns\\nare commonly given with this inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (31)\\n\\n1. Man never is, but always to be, blest.\\n\\n2. They follow an adventurer whom they fear; we serve a monarch whom we\\nlove. They boast, they come but to improve our state, enlarge our\\nthoughts, and free us from the yoke of error. Yes, they will give\\nenlightened freedom to our minds, who are themselves the slaves of\\npassion, avarice, and pride. They offer us their protection: yes, such\\nprotection as vultures give to lambs, covering and devouring them.\\n\\n\\n\\nMONOTONE. (32)\\n\\nRULE XIII.--The use of the monotone is confined chiefly to grave and\\nsolemn subjects. When carefully and properly employed, it gives great\\ndignity to delivery.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (32)\\n\\n1. The unbeliever! one who can gaze upon the sun, and moon, and stars, and\\nupon the unfading and imperishable sky, spread out so magnificently above\\nhim, and say, \"All this is the work of chance!\"\\n\\n2.

His broad expanded wings\\n   Lay calm and motionless upon the air,\\n   As if he floated there without their aid,\\n   By the sole act of his unlorded will.\\n\\n6. In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds\\n   On half the nations, and with fear of change\\n   Perplexes monarchs.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (33)\\n\\nACCENT.\\n\\nThat syllable in a word which is uttered more forcibly than the others, is\\nsaid to be accented, and is marked thus, (\\'); as the italicized syllables\\nin the following words:\\n\\nmorn\\'ing.     pos\\'si-ble.\\nty\\'rant.      re-cum\\'bent.\\npro-cure\\'.    ex-or\\'bi-tant,\\nde-bate\\'.     com-pre-hen\\'sive.\\n\\nCommon usage alone determines upon what syllable the accent should be\\nplaced, and to the lexicographer it belongs, to ascertain and record its\\ndecision on this point.\\n\\nIn some few cases, we can trace the reasons for common usage in this\\nrespect. In words which are used as different parts of speech, or which\\nhave different meanings, the distinction is sometimes denoted by changing\\nthe accent.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (33)\\n\\n   sub\\'ject   sub-ject\\'\\n   pres\\'ent   pre-sent\\'\\n   ab\\'sent    ab-sent\\'\\n   cem\\'ent    ce-ment\\'\\n   con\\'jure   con-jure\\'\\n\\n\\nThere is another case, in which we discover the reason for changing the\\naccent, and that is, when it is required by emphasis, as in the following:\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (33)\\n\\n1. His abil\\'ity or in\\'ability to perform the act materially varies\\n   the case.\\n2. This corrup\\'tion must put on in\\'corruption.\\n\\n\\n\\nSECONDARY ACCENT. (34)\\n\\nIn words of more than two syllables, there is often a second accent given,\\nbut more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary\\naccent; as, em\"igra\\'tion, rep\"artee\\', where the principal accent is marked\\n(\\'), and the secondary, (\"); so, also, this accent is obvious, in\\nnav\"iga\\'tion, com\"prehen\\'sion, plau\"sibil\\'ity, etc. The whole subject,\\nhowever, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.\\n\\n\\n\\nEMPHASIS. (34)\\n\\nEmphasis consists in uttering a word or phrase in such a manner as to give\\nit force and energy, and to draw the attention of the hearer particularly\\nto the idea expressed.\\n\\nThis is most frequently accomplished by an increased stress of voice laid\\nupon the word or phrase. Sometimes, though more rarely, the same object is\\neffected by an unusual lowering of the voice, even to a whisper, and not\\nunfrequently by a pause before the emphatic word.\\n\\nThe inflections are often made subsidiary to this object. To give emphasis\\nto a word, the inflection is changed or increased in force or extent. When\\nthe rising inflection is ordinarily used, the word, when emphatic,\\nfrequently takes the falling inflection; and sometimes, also, the falling\\ninflection is changed into the rising inflection, for the same purpose.\\n\\nEmphatic words are often denoted by being written in italics, in SMALL\\nCAPITALS, or in CAPITALS.\\n\\nMuch care is necessary to train the pupil to give clear and expressive\\nemphasis, and at the same time to avoid an unpleasant \"jerky\" movement of\\nthe voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nABSOLUTE EMPHASIS. (35)\\n\\nWhere the emphasis is independent of any contrast or comparison with\\nother words or ideas, it is called absolute emphasis.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (35)\\n\\n1. We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.\\n\\n2. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!\\n\\n3. Arm, warriors, arm!\\n\\n4. You know that you are Brutus, that speak this,\\n   Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\\n\\n5. Hamlet. Saw, who?\\n   Horatio. The king, your father.\\n   Hamlet. The king, my father?\\n\\n6. Strike--till the last armed foe expires;\\n   Strike--for your altars and your fires;\\n   Strike--for the green graves of your sites;\\n   God, and your native land!\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATIVE EMPHASIS. (35)\\n\\nWhere there is antithesis, either expressed or implied, the emphasis is\\ncalled relative.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (35)\\n\\n1.  We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.\\n\\n2.  But I am describing your condition, rather than my own.\\n\\n3.  I fear not death, and shall I then fear thee?\\n\\n4.  Hunting men, and not beasts, shall be his game.\\n\\n5. He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the\\nsins of the whole world.\\n\\n6. It may moderate and restrain, but it was not designed to banish\\ngladness from the heart of man.\\n\\nIn the following examples, there are two sets of antitheses in the same\\nsentence.\\n\\n7. To err is human, to forgive, divine.\\n\\n8. John was punished; William, rewarded.\\n\\n9. Without were fightings, within were fears.\\n\\n10. Business sweetens pleasure, as labor sweetens rest.\\n\\n11. Justice appropriates rewards to merit, and punishments to crime.\\n\\n12. On the one side, all was alacrity and courage; on the other, all was\\ntimidity and indecision.\\n\\n13. The wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation; the fool,\\nwhen he gains the applause of others.\\n\\n14. His care was to polish the country by art, as he had protected it by\\narms.\\n\\nIn the following examples, the relative emphasis is applied to three sets\\nof antithetic words.\\n\\n15. The difference between a madman and a fool is, that the former\\nreasons justly from false data; and the latter, erroneously from just data.\\n\\n16. He raised a mortal to the skies,\\n    She drew an angel down.\\n\\nSometimes the antithesis is implied, as in the following instances.\\n\\n17. The spirit of the white man\\'s heaven,\\n    Forbids not thee to weep.\\n\\n18. I shall enter on no encomiums upon Massachusetts.\\n\\n\\n\\nEMPHASIS AND ACCENT. (37)\\n\\nWhen words, which are the same in part of their formation, are contrasted,\\nthe emphasis is expressed by accenting the syllables in which they differ.\\nSee Accent, page 33.\\n\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (37)\\n\\n1.  What is the difference between probability and possibility?\\n\\n2.  Learn to unlearn what you have learned amiss.\\n\\n3.  John attends regularly. William, irregularly.\\n\\n4.  There is a great difference between giving and forgiving.\\n\\n5.  The conduct of Antoninus was characterized by justice and humanity;\\nthat of Nero, by injustice and inhumanity.\\n\\n6. The conduct of the former is deserving of approbation, while that of\\nthe latter merits the severest reprobation.\\n\\n\\nEMPHASIS AND INFLECTION. (37)\\n\\nEmphasis sometimes changes the inflection from the rising to the falling,\\nor from the falling to the rising. For instances of the former change, see\\nRule II, and Exception 1 to Rule IV. In the first three following\\nexamples, the inflection is changed from the rising to the falling\\ninflection; in the last three, it is changed from the falling to the\\nrising, by the influence of emphasis.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (37)\\n\\n\\n1. If we have no regard for religion in youth\\', we ought to have respect\\nfor it in age.\\n\\n2. If we have no regard for our own\\' character, we ought to regard the\\ncharacter of others.\\n\\n3. If content can not remove\\' the disquietudes of life, it will, at least,\\nalleviate them.\\n\\n4. The sweetest melody and the most perfect harmony fall powerless upon\\nthe ear of one who is deaf\\',\\n\\n5. It is useless to expatiate upon the beauties of nature to one who is\\nblind\\',\\n\\n6. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,\\nbecause they are brethren\\'; but rather let them do them service.\\n\\n\\n\\nEMPHATIC PHRASE. (38)\\n\\nWhen it is desired to give to a phrase great force of expression, each\\nword, and even the parts of a compound word, are independently emphasized.\\n\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (38)\\n\\n1. Cassius. Must I endure all this?\\n   Brutus. All this!--Ay,--more. Fret, till your proud--heart--break.\\n\\n2. What! weep you when you but behold\\n   Our Caesar\\'s vesture wounded? Look ye here,\\n   Here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.\\n\\n3. There was a time, my fellow-citizens, when the Lacedaemonians were\\nsovereign masters, both by sea and by land; while this state had not one\\nship--no, NOT--ONE--WALL.\\n\\n4. Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul; and not only of the Alpine\\nnations, but of the Alps themselves; shall I compare myself with this\\nHALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?\\n\\n5. You call me misbeliever--cutthroat--dog.\\n   Hath a dog--money? Is it possible--\\n   A cur can lend three--thousand--ducats?\\n\\n\\n\\nEMPHATIC PAUSE. (39)\\n\\nA short pause is often made before or after, and sometimes both before and\\nafter, an emphatic word or phrase,--thus very much increasing the emphatic\\nexpression of the thought.\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (39)\\n\\n1. May one be pardoned, and retain--the offense?\\n   In the corrupted currents of this world,\\n   Offense\\'s gilded hand may shove by--justice;\\n   And oft \\'tis seen, the wicked prize itself\\n   Buys out the law: but \\'t is not so--above:\\n   There--is no shuffling: there--the action lies\\n   In its true nature.\\n\\n2. He woke to hear his sentries shriek,\\n   \"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!\\n   He woke--to die--midst flame and smoke.\"\\n\\n3. This--is no flattery: These--are counselors\\n   That feelingly persuade me what I am.\\n\\n4. And this--our life, exempt from public haunt,\\n   Finds tongues--in tree, books--in the running brooks,\\n   Sermons--in stones, and--good in everything.\\n\\n5. Heaven gave this Lyre, and thus decreed,\\n   Be thou a bruised--but not a broken--reed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING VERSE. (39)\\n\\nINFLECTIONS.\\n\\nIn reading verse, the inflections should be nearly the same as in reading\\nprose; the chief difference is, that in poetry, the monotone and rising\\ninflection are more frequently used than in prose. The greatest difficulty\\nin reading this species of composition, consists in giving it that\\nmeasured flow which distinguishes it from prose, without falling into a\\nchanting pronunciation.\\n\\nIf, at any time, the reader is in doubt as to the proper inflection, let\\nhim reduce the passage to earnest conversation, and pronounce it in the\\nmost familiar and prosaic manner, and thus he will generally use the\\nproper inflection.\\n\\n\\nEXERCISES IN INFLECTION. (40)\\n\\n1. Meanwhile the south wind rose, and with black wings\\n   Wide hovering\\', all the clouds together drove\\n   From under heaven\\': the hills to their supply\\',\\n   Vapor and exhalation dusk and moist\\n   Sent up amain\\': and now, the thickened sky\\n   Like a dark ceiling stood\\': down rushed the rain\\n   Impetuous\\', and continued till the earth\\n   No more was seen\\': the floating vessel swam\\n   Uplifted\\', and, secure with beake\\'d prow\\',\\n   Rode tilting o\\'er the waves\\'.\\n\\n\\n2. My friend\\', adown life\\'s valley\\', hand in hand\\',\\n     With grateful change of grave and merry speech\\n     Or song\\', our hearts unlocking each to each\\',\\n   We\\'ll journey onward to the silent land\\';\\n   And when stern death shall loose that loving band,\\n     Taking in his cold hand, a hand of ours\\',\\n     The one shall strew the other\\'s grave with flowers\\',\\n   Nor shall his heart a moment be unmanned\\'.\\n   My friend and brother\\'! if thou goest first\\',\\n     Wilt thou no more revisit me below\\'?\\n   Yea, when my heart seems happy causelessly\\',\\n     And swells\\', not dreaming why\\', my soul shall know\\n   That thou\\', unseen\\', art bending over me\\'.\\n\\n\\n3. Here rests his head upon the lap of earth\\',\\n     A youth, to fortune and to fame unknown\\';\\n   Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth\\',\\n     And Melancholy marked him for her own\\'.\\n\\n\\n4. Large was his bounty\\', and his soul sincere\\',\\n     Heaven did a recompense as largely send\\';\\n   He gave to misery (all he had) a tear\\',\\n     He gained from heaven\\' (\\'t was all he wished\\') a friend\\'.\\n\\n\\n5. No further seek his merits to disclose\\',\\n     Or draw his frailties from their dread abode\\';\\n   (There they alike\\' in trembling hope repose\\',)\\n     The bosom of his Father, and his God\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (41)\\n\\nIn reading verse, every syllable must have the same accent, and every word\\nthe same emphasis as in prose; and whenever the melody or music of the\\nverse would lead to an incorrect accent or emphasis, this must be\\ndisregarded.\\n\\nIf a poet has made his verse deficient in melody, this must not be\\nremedied by the reader, at the expense of sense or the established rules\\nof accent and quantity. Take the following:\\n\\nEXAMPLE. (41)\\n\\n   O\\'er shields, and helms, and helme\\'d heads he rode,\\n   Of thrones, and mighty Seraphim prostrate\\n\\nAccording to the metrical accent, the last word must be pronounced\\n\"pros-trate\\'.\" But according to the authorized pronunciation it is\\n\"pros\\'trate. Which shall yield, the poet or established usage? Certainly\\nnot the latter.\\n\\nSome writers advise a compromise of the matter, and that the word should\\nhe pronounced without accenting either syllable. Sometimes this may be\\ndone, but where it is not practiced, the prosaic reading should be\\npreserved.\\n\\nIn the following examples, the words and syllables which are improperly\\naccented or emphasized in the poetry, are marked in italics. According to\\nthe principle stated above, the reader should avoid giving them that\\npronunciation which the correct rending of the poetry would require, but\\nshould read them as prose, except where he can throw off all accent and\\nthus compromise the conflict between the poetic reading and the correct\\nreading. That is, he must read the poetry wrong, in order to read the\\nlanguage right.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (42)\\n\\n1. Ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made\\n   Taller and stronger than the weeds they shade.\\n\\n2. Their praise is still, \"the style is excellent,\"\\n   The sense they humbly take upon content.\\n\\n3. False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,\\n   Its fairy colors spreads on every place.\\n\\n4. To do aught good, never will be our task,\\n   But ever to do ill is our sole delight.\\n\\n5. Of all the causes which combine to blind\\n   Man\\'s erring judgment, and mislead the mind,\\n   What the weak head with strongest bias rules\\n   Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.\\n\\n6. Eye Nature\\'s walks, shoot folly as it flies,\\n   And catch the manners living as they rise.\\n\\n7. To whom then, first incensed, Adam replied,\\n   \"Is this thy love, is this the recompense\\n   Of mine to thee, ungrateful Eve?\"\\n\\n8. We may, with more successful hope, resolve\\n   To wage, by force or guile, successful war,\\n   Irreconcilable to our grand foe,\\n   Who now triumphs, and in excess of joy\\n   Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.\\n\\n9. Which, when Beelzebub perceived (than whom,\\n   Satan except, none higher sat), with grave\\n   Aspect, he rose, and in his rising seemed\\n   A pillar of state.\\n\\n10. Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,\\n    That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,\\n    Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget,\\n    Those other two equaled with me in fate.\\n\\nNOTE.--Although it would be necessary, in these examples, to violate the\\nlaws of accent or emphasis, to give perfect rhythm, yet a careful and\\nwell-trained reader will be able to observe these laws and still give the\\nrhythm in such a manner that the defect will scarcely be noticed.\\n\\nPOETIC PAUSES. (43)\\n\\nIn order to make the measure of poetry perceptible to the ear, there\\nshould generally be a slight pause at the end of each line, even where the\\nsense does not require it.\\n\\nThere is, also, in almost every line of poetry, a pause at or near its\\nmiddle, which is called the caesura.\\n\\nThis should, however, never be so placed as to injure the sense of the\\npassage. It is indeed reckoned a great beauty, where it naturally\\ncoincides with the pause required by the sense. The caesura, though\\ngenerally placed near the middle, may be placed at other intervals.\\n\\nThere are sometimes, also, two additional pauses in each line, called\\ndemi-caesuras.\\n\\nThe caesura is marked (||), and the demi-caesura thus, (|), in the\\nexamples given.\\n\\nThere should be a marked accent upon the long syllable next preceding\\nthe caesura, and a slighter one upon that next before each of the\\ndemi-caesuras. When made too prominent, these pauses lead to a singsong\\nstyle, which should be carefully avoided.\\n\\nIn the following examples, the caesura is marked in each line; the\\ndemi-caesura is not marked in every case.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (44)\\n\\n1. Nature | to all things || fixed | the limits fit,\\n   And wisely | curbed || proud man\\'s | pretending wit.\\n\\n2. Then from his closing eyes || thy form shall part,\\n   And the last pang || shall tear thee from his heart.\\n\\n3. Warms in the sun, || refreshes in the breeze,\\n   Glows in the stars, || and blossoms in the trees.\\n\\n4. There is a land || of every land the pride,\\n   Beloved by Heaven || o\\'er all the world beside,\\n   Where brighter suns || dispense serener light,\\n   And milder moons || imparadise the night;\\n   Oh, thou shalt find, || howe\\'er thy footsteps roam,\\n   That land--thy country, || and that spot--thy home.\\n\\n5. In slumbers | of midnight || the sailor | boy lay;\\n     His hammock | swung loose || at the sport | of the wind;\\n   But, watch-worn | and weary, || his cares | flew away,\\n     And visions | of happiness || danced | o\\'er his mind.\\n\\n6. She said, | and struck; || deep entered | in her side\\n   The piercing steel, || with reeking purple dyed:\\n   Clogged | in the wound || the cruel | weapon stands,\\n   The spouting blood || came streaming o\\'er her hands.\\n   Her sad attendants || saw the deadly stroke,\\n   And with loud cries || the sounding palace shook.\\n\\n\\n\\nSIMILE. (44)\\n\\nSimile is the likening of anything to another object of a different class;\\nit is a poetical or imaginative comparison.\\n\\nA simile, in poetry, should usually he read in a lower key and more\\nrapidly than other parts of the passage--somewhat as a parenthesis is\\nread.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES. (45)\\n\\n1. Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal\\n   With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form.\\n   As when, to warn proud cities, war appears,\\n   Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush\\n   To battle in the clouds.\\n   Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell,\\n   Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air\\n   In whirlwind. Hell scarce holds the wild uproar.\\n   As when Alcides felt the envenomed robe, and tore,\\n   Through pain, up by the roots, Thessialian pines,\\n   And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw\\n   Into the Euboic sea.\\n\\n2.                    Each at the head,\\n   Leveled his deadly aim; their fatal hands\\n   No second stroke intend; and such a frown\\n   Each cast at th\\' other, as when two black clouds,\\n   With heaven\\'s artillery fraught, came rolling on\\n   Over the Caspian, there stand front to front,\\n   Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow\\n   To join the dark encounter, in mid-air:\\n   So frowned the mighty combatants.\\n\\n3. Then pleased and thankful from the porch they go\\n   And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:\\n   His cup was vanished; for, in secret guise,\\n   The younger guest purloined the glittering prize.\\n   As one who spies a serpent in his way,\\n   Glistening and basking in the summer ray,\\n   Disordered, stops to shun the danger near,\\n   Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear,--\\n   So seemed the sire, when, far upon the road,\\n   The shining spoil his wily partner showed.\\n\\n\\n\\nV. THE VOICE. (46)\\n\\nPITCH AND COMPASS.\\n\\nThe natural pitch of the voice is its keynote, or governing note. It is\\nthat on which the voice usually dwells, and to which it most frequently\\nreturns when wearied. It is also the pitch used in conversation, and the\\none which a reader or speaker naturally adopts--when he reads or speaks--\\nmost easily and agreeably.\\n\\nThe compass of the voice is its range above and below this pitch. To avoid\\nmonotony in reading or speaking, the voice should rise above or fall below\\nthis keynote, but always with reference to the sense or character of that\\nwhich is read or spoken. The proper natural pitch is that above and below\\nwhich there is most room for variation.\\n\\nTo strengthen the voice and increase its compass, select a short sentence,\\nrepeat it several times in succession in as low a key as the voice can\\nsound naturally; then rise one note higher, and practice on that key, then\\nanother, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice has been reached.\\nNext, reverse the process, until the lowest pitch has been reached.\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLES IN PITCH (46)\\n\\nHigh Pitch.\\n\\nNOTE.--Be careful to distinguish pitch from power in the following\\nexercise. Speaking in the open air, at the very top of the voice, is an\\nexercise admirably adapted to strengthen the voice and give it compass,\\nand should be frequently practiced.\\n\\n1. Charge\\'! Chester\" charge\\'! On\\'! Stanley, on\\'!\\n\\n2. A horse\\'! a horse\\'! my kingdom\\' for a horse\\'!\\n\\n3. Jump far out\\', boy\\' into the wave\\'!\\n   Jump\\', or I fire\\'!\\n\\n4. Run\\'! run\\'! run for your lives!\\n\\n5. Fire\\'! fire\\'! fire\\'! Ring the bell\\'!\\n\\n6. Gentlemen may cry peace\\'! peace\\'! but there is no peace!\\n\\n7. Rouse\\' ye Romans!  rouse\\' ye slaves\\'!\\n   Have ye brave sons\\'? Look in the next fierce brawl\\n   To see them die\\'. Have ye fair daughters\\'? Look\\n   To see them live, torn from your arms\\', distained\\',\\n   Dishonored\\', and if ye dare call for justice\\',\\n   Be answered by the lash\\'!\\n\\nMedium Pitch. (47)\\n\\nNOTE.--This is the pitch in which we converse. To strengthen it, we should\\nread or speak in it as loud as possible, without rising to a higher key.\\nTo do this requires long-continued practice.\\n\\n1. Under a spreading chestnut tree,\\n     The village smithy stands\\';\\n   The smith, a mighty man is he,\\n     With large and sinewy hands\\';\\n   And the muscles of his brawny arms\\n     Are strong as iron bands.\\n\\n2. There is something in the thunder\\'s voice that makes me tremble like a\\nchild. I have tried to conquer\\' this unmanly weakness\\'. I have called\\npride\\' to my aid\\'; I have sought for moral courage in the lessons of\\nphilosophy\\', but it avails me nothing\\'. At the first moaning of the\\ndistant cloud, my heart shrinks and dies within me.\\n\\n3. He taught the scholars the Rule of Three\\',\\n     Reading, and writing, and history\\', too\\';\\n   He took the little ones on his knee\\',\\n   For a kind old heart in his breast had he\\',\\n     And the wants of the littlest child he knew\\'.\\n   \"Learn while you\\'re young\\',\" he often said\\',\\n     \"There is much to enjoy down here below\\';\\n   Life for the living\\', and rest for the dead\\',\"\\n     Said the jolly old pedagogue\\' long ago\\'.\\n\\n\\nLow Pitch. (48)\\n\\n1.    O, proper stuff!\\n   This is the very painting of your fear:\\n   This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,\\n   Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,\\n   Impostors to true fear, would well become\\n   A woman\\'s story at a winter\\'s fire.\\n   Authorized by her grandam.\\n\\n2.    Thou slave! thou wretch! thou coward!\\n   Thou little valiant, great in villainy!\\n   Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!\\n   Thou fortune\\'s champion, thou dost never fight\\n   But when her humorous ladyship is by\\n   To teach thee safety! Thou art perjured too,\\n   And sooth\\'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,\\n   A ramping fool; to brag, and stamp, and sweat,\\n   Upon my party! thou cold-blooded slave!\\n\\n3. God! thou art mighty!  At thy footstool bound,\\n   Lie, gazing to thee, Chance, and Life, and Death;\\n   Nor in the angel circle flaming round,\\n   Nor in the million worlds that blaze beneath,\\n   Is one that can withstand thy wrath\\'s hot breath.\\n   Woe, in thy frown: in thy smile, victory:\\n   Hear my last prayer! I ask no mortal wreath;\\n   Let but these eyes my rescued country see,\\n   Then take my spirit, all Omnipotent, to thee.\\n\\n4. O Thou eternal One! whose presence bright\\n     All space doth occupy, all motion guide,\\n   Unchanged through time\\'s all-devastating blight!\\n     Thou only God, there is no god beside!\\n   Being above all things, mighty One,\\n     Whom none can comprehend and none explore;\\n   Who fill\\'st existence with thyself alone,--\\n     Embracing all, supporting, ruling o\\'er,--\\n     Being whom we call God, and know no more!\\n\\n\\n\\nQUANTITY AND QUALITY. (49)\\n\\nQuantity, in reading and speaking, means the length of time occupied in\\nuttering a syllable or a word. Sounds and syllables vary greatly in\\nquantity. Some are long, some short, and others intermediate between those\\nwhich are long or short. Some sounds, also, may be prolonged or shortened\\nin utterance to any desired extent. Quantity may be classified as Long,\\nMedium, or Short.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS FOR PRACTICE ON LONG QUANTITY.--Select some word of one\\nsyllable ending with a long vocal or a subvocal sound; pronounce it many\\ntimes in succession, increasing the quantity at each repetition, until you\\ncan dwell upon it any desired length of time, without drawling, and in a\\nnatural tone.\\n\\nREMARK.--Practice in accordance with this direction will enable the pupil\\nto secure that fullness and roundness of voice which is exemplified in the\\nhailing of a ship, \"ship aho--y;\" in the reply of the sailor, when, in the\\nroar of the storm, he answers his captain, \"ay--e. ay--e;\" and in the\\ncommand of the officer to his troops, when, amid the thunder of artillery,\\nhe gives the order, \"ma--rch,\" or \"ha--lt.\"\\n\\nThis fullness or roundness of tone is secured, by dwelling on the vocal\\nsound, and indefinitely protracting it, The mouth should be opened wide,\\nthe tongue kept down, and the aperture left as round and as free for the\\nvoice as possible.\\n\\nIt is this artificial rotundity which, in connection with a distinct\\narticulation, enables one who speaks in the open air, or in a very large\\napartment, to send his voice to the most distant point. It is a certain\\ndegree of this quality, which distinguishes declamatory or public speaking\\nor reading from private conversation, and no one can accomplish much, as a\\npublic speaker, without cultivating it. It must be carefully distinguished\\nfrom the \"high tone,\" which is an elevation of pitch, and from \"loudness.\"\\nor \"strength\" of voice.\\n\\nIt will be observed that clearness and distinctness of utterance are\\nsecured by a proper use of the subvocals and aspirates--these sounds\\ngiving to words their shape, as it were; but a clear, full, and\\nwell-modulated utterance of the vocals gives to words their fullness.\\n\\n\\nLONG QUANTITY. (49)\\n\\n1. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!\\n\\n2. Woe, woe, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem!\\n\\n3. O righteous Heaven! ere Freedom found a grave,\\n   Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save?\\n   Where was thine arm, O Vengeance! where thy rod,\\n   That smote the foes of Zion and of God?\\n\\n4. O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again\\n   Shall home, love, or kindred thy wishes repay;\\n   Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,\\n   Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.\\n\\n5. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast\\nset thy glory above the heavens! When I consider thy heavens, the work of\\nthy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is\\nman, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest\\nhim? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast\\ncrowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over\\nthe work of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. O Lord,\\nour Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!\\n\\n\\nMEDIUM QUANTITY. (50)\\n\\n1. Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;\\n     The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;\\n   The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,\\n     To which the said spectacles ought to belong.\\n\\n2. Bird of the broad and sweeping wing!\\n     Thy home is high in heaven,\\n   Where the wide storms their banners fling,\\n     And the tempest clouds are driven.\\n\\n3. At midnight, in his guarded tent,\\n     The Turk lay dreaming of the hour\\n   When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,\\n     Should tremble at his power.\\n\\n4. On New Year\\'s night, an old man stood at his window, and looked, with a\\nglance of fearful despair, up the immovable, unfading heaven, and down\\nupon the still, pure, white earth, on which no one was now so joyless and\\nsleepless as he.\\n\\n\\n\\nSHORT QUANTITY. (51)\\n\\n1. Quick! or he faints! stand with the cordial near!\\n\\n2. Back to thy punishment, false fugitive!\\n\\n3. Fret till your proud heart breaks!  Must I observe you? Must I crouch\\nbeneath your testy humor?\\n\\n4. Up drawbridge, grooms! what, warder, ho!\\n   Let the portcullis fall!\\n\\n5. Quick, man the lifeboat! see yon bark,\\n     That drives before the blast!\\n   There\\'s a rock ahead, the fog is dark,\\n     And the storm comes thick and fast.\\n\\n6. I am at liberty, like every other man, to use my own language; and\\nthough, perhaps, I may have some ambition to please this gentleman, I\\nshall not by myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his\\ndiction, or his mien, however matured by age or modeled by experience.\\n\\n\\nMOVEMENT. (51)\\n\\nMovement is the rapidity with which the voice moves in reading and\\nspeaking. It varies with the nature of the thought or sentiment to be\\nexpressed, and should be increased or diminished as good taste may\\ndetermine. With pupils generally, the tendency is to read too fast. The\\nresult is, reading or speaking in too high a key and an unnatural style of\\ndelivery--both of which faults are difficult to be corrected when once\\nformed. The kinds of movement are Slow, Moderate, and Quick.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS.--Read a selection as slowly us possible, without drawling.\\nRead it again and again, increasing the rate of movement at each reading,\\nuntil it can be read no faster without the utterance becoming indistinct.\\nReverse this process, reading more and more slowly at each repetition,\\nuntil the slowest movement is obtained.\\n\\n\\nSLOW MOVEMENT. (52)\\n\\n1. Oh that those lips had language! Life has passed\\n   With me but roughly, since I heard them last.\\n\\n2. A tremulous sigh from the gentle night wind\\n     Through the forest leaves slowly is creeping,\\n   While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,\\n     Keep guard; for the army is sleeping.\\n\\n3. O Lord\\'! have mercy upon us, miserable offenders\\'!\\n\\n4. So live, that when thy summons comes to join\\n   The innumerable caravan that moves\\n   To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take\\n   His chamber in the silent halls of death,\\n   Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,\\n   Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\\n   By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave\\n   Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch\\n   About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\\n\\n\\nMODERATE MOVEMENT. (52)\\n\\n1. The good\\', the brave\\', the beautiful\\',\\n     How dreamless\\' is their sleep,\\n   Where rolls the dirge-like music\\'\\n     Of the over-tossing deep\\'!\\n   Or where the surging night winds\\n     Pale Winter\\'s robes have spread\\n   Above the narrow palaces,\\n     In the cities of the dead\\'!\\n\\n2. Lives of great men all remind us\\n     We can make our lives sublime,\\n   And, departing, leave behind us\\n     Footprints on the sands of time.\\n\\n3. Cast your eyes over this extensive country. Observe the salubrity of\\nyour climate, the variety and fertility of your soil; and see that soil\\nintersected in every quarter by bold, navigable streams, flowing to the\\neast and to the west, as if the finger of heaven were marking out the\\ncourse of your settlements, inviting you to enterprise, and pointing the\\nway to wealth.\\n\\n\\nQUICK MOVEMENT.

Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace--\\n   Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;\\n   I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,\\n   Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,\\n   Rebuckled the check strap, chained slacker the bit,\\n   Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.\\n\\n4. Oh my dear uncle, you don\\'t know the effect of a fine spring morning\\nupon a fellow just arrived from Russia. The day looked bright, trees\\nbudding, birds singing, the park so gay, that I took a leap out of your\\nbalcony, made your deer fly before me like the wind, and chased them all\\naround the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while you were snoring\\nin bed, uncle.\\n\\n\\nQuality.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of\\npersuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh,\\nirregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the\\nplaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow\\nof words in argumentative style. This difference consists in a variation\\nin the quality of the voice by which it is adapted to the character of the\\nthought or sentiment read or spoken. In our attempts to imitate nature,\\nhowever, it is important that all affectation be avoided, for perfect\\nmonotony is preferable to this fault.

GESTURE. (55)\\n\\nGesture is that part of the speaker\\'s manner which pertains to his\\nattitude, to the use and carriage of his person, and the movement of his\\nlimbs in delivery.\\n\\nEvery person, in beginning to speak, feels the natural embarrassment\\nresulting from his new position. The novelty of the situation destroys his\\nself-possession, and, with the loss of that, he becomes awkward, his arms\\nand hands hang clumsily, and now, for the first time, seem to him worse\\nthan superfluous members. This embarrassment will be overcome gradually,\\nas the speaker becomes familiar with his position; and it is sometimes\\novercome at once, by a powerful exercise of the attention upon the matter\\nof the speech. When that fills and possesses the mind, the orator is\\nlikely to take the attitude which is becoming, and, at least, easy and\\nnatural, if not graceful.\\n\\n1st. The first general direction that should be given to the speaker is,\\nthat he should stand erect and firm, and in that posture which gives an\\nexpanded chest and full play to the organs of respiration and utterance.\\n\\n2d. Let the attitude be such that it can be shifted easily and gracefully.\\nThe student will find, by trial, that no attitude is so favorable to this\\nend as that in which the weight of the body is thrown upon one leg,\\nleaving the other free to be advanced or thrown back, as fatigue or the\\nproper action of delivery may require.\\n\\nThe student who has any regard to grace or elegance, will of course avoid\\nall the gross faults which are so common among public speakers, such as\\nresting one foot upon a stool or bench, or throwing the body forward upon\\nthe support of the rostrum.\\n\\n3d. Next to attitude, come the movements of the person and limbs. In\\nthese, two objects are to be observed, and, if possible, combined, viz.,\\npropriety and grace. There is expression in the extended arm, the clinched\\nhand, the open palm, and the smiting of the breast. But let no gesture be\\nmade that is not in harmony with the thought or sentiment uttered; for it\\nis this harmony which constitutes propriety. As far as possible, let there\\nbe a correspondence between the style of action and the train of thought.\\nWhere the thought flows on calmly, let there be grace and ease in gesture\\nand action. Where the style is sharp and abrupt, there is propriety in\\nquick, short, and abrupt gesticulation. Especially avoid that ungraceful\\nsawing of the air with the arms, into which all ill-regulated fervor\\nbetrays many young speakers.\\n\\nWhat is called graceful manner, can only be attained by those who have\\nsome natural advantages of person. So far as it is in the reach of study\\nor practice, it seems to depend chiefly upon the general cultivation of\\nmanners, implying freedom from all embarrassments, and entire\\nself-possession. The secret of acquiring a graceful style of gesture,\\nwe apprehend, lies in the habitual practice, not only when speaking but\\nat all times, of free and graceful movements of the limbs.\\n\\nThere is no limb nor feature which the accomplished speaker will not\\nemploy with effect, in the course of a various and animated delivery. The\\narms, however, are the chief reliance of the orator in gesture; and it\\nwill not be amiss to give a hint or two in reference to their proper use.\\n\\nFirst--It is not an uncommon fault to use one arm exclusively, and to give\\nthat a uniform movement. Such movement may, sometimes, have become\\nhabitual from one\\'s profession or employment; but in learners, also, there\\nis often a predisposition to this fault.\\n\\nSecond--It is not unusual to see a speaker use only the lower half of his\\narm. This always gives a stiff and constrained manner to delivery. Let the\\nwhole arm move, and let the movement be free and flowing.\\n\\nThird--As a general rule, let the hand be open, with the fingers slightly\\ncurved. It then seems liberal, communicative, and candid; and, in some\\ndegree, gives that expression to the style of delivery. Of course there\\nare passages which require the clinched hand, the pointed finger, etc.,\\netc.; but these are used to give a particular expression.\\n\\nFourth--In the movements of the arm, study variety and the grace of curved\\nlines.\\n\\nWhen a gesture is made with one arm only, the eye should be cast in the\\ndirection of that arm; not at it, but over it.\\n\\nAll speakers employ, more or less, the motions of the head. In reference\\nto that member, we make but one observation. Avoid the continuous shaking\\nand bobbing of the head, which is so conspicuous in the action of many\\nambitious public speakers.\\n\\nThe beauty and force of all gesture consist in its timely, judicious, and\\nnatural employment, when it can serve to illustrate the meaning or give\\nemphasis to the force of an important passage. The usual fault of young\\nspeakers is too much action. To emphasize all parts alike, is equivalent\\nto no emphasis; and by employing forcible gestures on unimportant\\npassages, we diminish our power to render other parts impressive.\\n\\n\\n\\nELOCUTION AND READING. (57)\\n\\nThe business of training youth in elocution, must be commenced in\\nchildhood. The first school is the nursery. There, at least, may be formed\\na distinct articulation, which is the first requisite for good speaking.\\nHow rarely is it found in perfection among our orators.\\n\\n\"Words,\" says one, referring to articulation, should \"be delivered out\\nfrom the lips, as beautiful coins, newly issued from the mint; deeply and\\naccurately impressed, perfectly finished; neatly struck by the proper\\norgans, distinct, in due succession, and of due weight.\" How rarely do we\\nhear a speaker whose tongue, teeth, and lips, do their office so perfectly\\nas to answer to this beautiful description! And the common faults in\\narticulation, it should be remembered, take their rise from the very\\nnursery.\\n\\nGrace in eloquence, in the pulpit, at the bar, can not be separated from\\ngrace in the ordinary manners, in private life, in the social circle, in\\nthe family. It can not well be superinduced upon all the other\\nacquisitions of youth, any more than that nameless, but invaluable,\\nquality called good breeding. Begin, therefore, the work of forming the\\norator with the child; not merely by teaching him to declaim, but what is\\nof more consequence, by observing and correcting his daily manners,\\nmotions, and attitudes. You can say, when he comes into your apartment, or\\npresents you with something, a book or letter, in an awkward and\\nblundering manner, \"Return, and enter this room again,\" or, \"Present me\\nthat book in a different manner,\" or, \"Put yourself in a different\\nattitude.\" You can explain to him the difference between thrusting or\\npushing out his hand and arm, in straight lines and at acute angles, and\\nmoving them in flowing circular lines, and easy graceful action. He will\\nreadily understand you. Nothing is more true than that the motions of\\nchildren are originally graceful; it is by suffering them to be perverted,\\nthat we lay the foundation of invincible awkwardness in later life.\\n\\nIn schools for children, it ought to be a leading object to teach the art\\nof reading. It ought to occupy threefold more time than it does. The\\nteachers of these schools should labor to improve themselves. They should\\nfeel that to them, for a time, are committed the future orators of the\\nland.\\n\\nIt is better that a girl should return from school a first-rate reader,\\nthan a first-rate performer on the pianoforte. The accomplishment, in its\\nperfection, would give more pleasure. The voice of song is not sweeter\\nthan the voice of eloquence; and there may be eloquent readers, as well as\\neloquent speakers. We speak of perfection in this art: and it is\\nsomething, we must say in defense of our preference, which we have never\\nyet seen. Let the same pains be devoted to reading, as are required to\\nform an accomplished performer on an instrument; let us have, as the\\nancients had, the formers of the voice, the music masters of the reading\\nvoice; let us see years devoted to this accomplishment, and then we should\\nbe prepared to stand the comparison.\\n\\nReading is indeed, a most intellectual accomplishment. So is music, too,\\nin its perfection. We do by no means undervalue this noble and most\\ndelightful art, to which Socrates applied himself even in his old age. But\\none recommendation of the art of reading is, that it requires a constant\\nexercise of mind. It involves, in its perfection, the whole art of\\ncriticism on language. A man may possess a fine genius without being a\\nperfect reader; but he can not be a perfect reader without genius.\\n\\nON MODULATION.

(61)\\n\\n\\n\\nMCGUFFEY\\'S SIXTH READER. (63)\\n\\n\\nSELECTIONS FOR READING.\\n\\n\\nI. ANECDOTE OF THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.\\n\\nA laughable story was circulated during the administration of the old Duke\\nof Newcastle, and retailed to the public in various forms. This nobleman,\\nwith many good points, was remarkable for being profuse of his promises on\\nall occasions, and valued himself particularly on being able to anticipate\\nthe words or the wants of the various persons who attended his levees,\\nbefore they uttered a word. This sometimes led him into ridiculous\\nembarrassment; and it was this proneness to lavish promises, which gave\\noccasion for the following anecdote:\\n\\nAt the election of a certain borough in Cornwall, where the opposite\\ninterests were almost equally poised, a single vote was of the highest\\nimportance. This object the Duke, by well applied argument and personal\\napplication, at length attained; and the gentleman he recommended, gained\\nthe election. In the warmth of gratitude, his grace poured forth\\nacknowledgments and promises without ceasing, on the fortunate possessor\\nof the casting vote; called him his best and dearest friend; protested,\\nthat he should consider himself as forever indebted to him; and that he\\nwould serve him by night or by day.\\n\\nThe Cornish voter, who was an honest fellow, and would not have thought\\nhimself entitled to any reward, but for such a torrent of acknowledgments,\\nthanked the Duke for his kindness, and told him the supervisor of excise\\nwas old and infirm, and, if he would have the goodness to recommend his\\nson-in-law to the commissioners, in case of the old man\\'s death, he should\\nthink himself and his family bound to render his grace every assistance in\\ntheir power, on any future occasion.\\n\\n\"My dear friend, why do you ask for such a trifling employment?\" exclaimed\\nhis grace; \"your relative shall have it the moment the place is vacant, if\\nyou will but call my attention to it.\"\\n\\n\"But how shall I get admitted to you, my lord? For in London, I\\nunderstand, it is a very difficult business to get a sight of you great\\nfolks, though you are so kind and complaisant to us in the country.\"\\n\\n\"The instant the man dies,\" replied the Duke, \"set out posthaste for\\nLondon; drive directly to my house, and, be it by night or by day, thunder\\nat the door; I will leave word with my porter to show you upstairs\\ndirectly; and the employment shall be disposed of according to your\\nwishes.\"\\n\\nThe parties separated; the Duke drove to a friend\\'s house in the\\nneighborhood, without a wish or desire to see his new acquaintance till\\nthat day seven years; but the memory of the Cornish elector, not being\\nburdened with such a variety of objects, was more retentive. The\\nsupervisor died a few months after, and the Duke\\'s humble friend, relying\\non the word of a peer, was conveyed to London posthaste, and ascended with\\nalacrity the steps of that nobleman\\'s palace.\\n\\nThe reader should be informed, that just at this time, no less a person\\nthan the King of Spain was expected hourly to depart this life, an event\\nin which the minister of Great Britain was particularly concerned; and the\\nDuke of Newcastle, on the very night that the proprietor of the decisive\\nvote arrived at his door, had sat up anxiously expecting dispatches from\\nMadrid. Wearied by official business and agitated spirits, he retired to\\nrest, having previously given particular instructions to his porter not to\\ngo to bed, as he expected every minute a messenger with advices of the\\ngreatest importance, and desired that he might be shown upstairs, the\\nmoment of his arrival.\\n\\nHis grace was sound asleep; and the porter, settled for the night in his\\narmchair, had already commenced a sonorous nap, when the vigorous arm of\\nthe Cornish voter roused him from his slumbers. To his first question, \"Is\\nthe Duke at home?\" the porter replied, \"Yes, and in bed; but has left\\nparticular orders that, come when you will, you are to go up to him\\ndirectly.\"\\n\\n\"Bless him, for a worthy and honest gentleman,\" cried our applicant for\\nthe vacant post, smiling and nodding with approbation at the prime\\nminister\\'s kindness, \"how punctual his grace is; I knew he would not\\ndeceive me; let me hear no more of lords and dukes not keeping their\\nwords; I verily believe they are as honest, and mean as well as any other\\nfolks.\" Having ascended the stairs as he was speaking, he was ushered into\\nthe Duke\\'s bedchamber.\\n\\n\"Is he dead?\" exclaimed his grace, rubbing his eyes, and scarcely awakened\\nfrom dreaming of the King of Spain, \"Is he dead?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied the eager expectant, delighted to find the\\nelection promise, with all its circumstances, so fresh in the nobleman\\'s\\nmemory.\\n\\n\"When did he die?\"\\n\\n\"The day before yesterday, exactly at half past one o\\'clock, after being\\nconfined three weeks to his bed, and taking a power of doctor\\'s stuff; and\\nI hope your grace will be as good as your word, and let my son-in-law\\nsucceed him.\"\\n\\nThe Duke, by this time perfectly awake, was staggered at the impossibility\\nof receiving intelligence from Madrid in so short a space of time; and\\nperplexed at the absurdity of a king\\'s messenger applying for his\\nson-in-law to succeed the King of Spain: \"Is the man drunk, or mad? Where\\nare your dispatches?\" exclaimed his grace, hastily drawing back his\\ncurtain; where, instead of a royal courier, he recognized at the bedside,\\nthe fat, good-humored countenance of his friend from Cornwall, making low\\nbows, with hat in hand, and \"hoping my lord would not forget the gracious\\npromise he was so good as to make, in favor of his son-in-law, at the last\\nelection.\"\\n\\nVexed at so untimely a disturbance, and disappointed of news from Spain,\\nthe Duke frowned for a moment; but chagrin soon gave way to mirth, at so\\nsingular and ridiculous a combination of circumstances, and, yielding to\\nthe impulse, he sunk upon the bed in a violent fit of laughter, which was\\ncommunicated in a moment to the attendants.\\n\\nThe relater of this little narrative, concludes, with observing, \"Although\\nthe Duke of Newcastle could not place the relative of his old acquaintance\\non the throne of His Catholic Majesty, he advanced him to a post not less\\nhonorable--he made him an exciseman.\"\\n                                                   --Blackwood\\'s Magazine.\\n\\n[Illustration: Bedroom: The Duke is startled awake, sitting up in bed with\\ndistressed look on his face.

DAWN. (68)\\n\\nEdward Everett, 1794-1865. He was born at Dorchester, Mass., now a part of\\nBoston, and graduated from Harvard College with the highest honors of his\\nclass, at the age of seventeen. While yet in college, he had quite a\\nreputation as a brilliant writer. Before he was twenty years of age, he\\nwas settled as pastor over the Brattle Street Church, in Boston, and at\\nonce became famous as an eloquent preacher. In 1814, he was elected\\nProfessor of Greek Literature in his Alma Mater; and, in order to prepare\\nhimself for the duties of his office, he entered on an extended course of\\ntravel in Europe. He edited the \"North American Review,\" in addition to\\nthe labors of his professorship, after he returned to America.\\n\\nIn 1825, Mr. Everett was elected to Congress, and held his seat in the\\nHouse for ten years. He was Governor of his native state from 1835 to\\n1839. In 1841, he was appointed Minister to England. On his return, in\\n1846, he was chosen President of Harvard University, and held the office\\nfor three years. In 1852, he was appointed Secretary of State. February\\n22, 1856, he delivered, in Boston, his celebrated lecture on Washington.\\nThis lecture was afterwards delivered in most of the principal cities and\\ntowns in the United States. The proceeds were devoted to the purchase of\\nMt. Vernon. In 1860, he was a candidate for the Vice Presidency of the\\nUnited States, He is celebrated as an elegant and forcible writer, and a\\nchaste orator.\\n\\nThis extract, a wonderful piece of word painting, is a portion of an\\naddress on the \"Uses of Astronomy,\" delivered at the inauguration of the\\nDudley Observatory, at Albany, N, Y, Note the careful use of words, and\\nthe strong figures in the third and fourth paragraphs.\\n###\\n\\n\\nI had occasion, a few weeks since, to take the early train from Providence\\nto Boston; and for this purpose rose at two o\\'clock in the morning.\\nEverything around was wrapped in darkness and hushed in silence, broken\\nonly by what seemed at that hour the unearthly clank and rush of the\\ntrain. It was a mild, serene, midsummer\\'s night,--the sky was without a\\ncloud, the winds were whist. The moon, then in the last quarter, had just\\nrisen, and the stars shone with a spectral luster but little affected by\\nher presence.\\n\\nJupiter, two hours high, was the herald of the day; the Pleiades, just\\nabove the horizon, shed their sweet influence in the east; Lyra sparkled\\nnear the zenith; Andromeda veiled her newly-discovered glories from the\\nnaked eye in the south; the steady Pointers, far beneath the pole, looked\\nmeekly up from the depths of the north to their sovereign.\\n\\nSuch was the glorious spectacle as I entered the train. As we proceeded,\\nthe timid approach of twilight became more perceptible; the intense blue\\nof the sky began to soften; the smaller stars, like little children, went\\nfirst to rest; the sister beams of the Pleiades soon melted together; but\\nthe bright constellations of the west and north remained unchanged.\\nSteadily the wondrous transfiguration went on. Hands of angels, hidden\\nfrom mortal eyes, shifted the scenery of the heavens; the glories of night\\ndissolved into the glories of the dawn.\\n\\nThe blue sky now turned more softly gray; the great watch stars shut up\\ntheir holy eyes; the east began to kindle. Faint streaks of purple soon\\nblushed along the sky; the whole celestial concave was filled with the\\ninflowing tides of the morning light, which came pouring down from above\\nin one great ocean of radiance; till at length, as we reached the Blue\\nHills, a flash of purple fire blazed out from above the horizon, and\\nturned the dewy teardrops of flower and leaf into rubies and diamonds. In\\na few seconds, the everlasting gates of the morning were thrown wide open,\\nand the lord of day, arrayed in glories too severe for the gaze of man,\\nbegan his state.\\n\\nI do not wonder at the superstition of the ancient Magians, who, in the\\nmorning of the world, went up to the hilltops of Central Asia, and,\\nignorant of the true God, adored the most glorious work of his hand.

DESCRIPTION OF A STORM. (70)\\n\\nBenjamin Disraeli. 1805-1881, was of Jewish descent. His ancestors were\\ndriven out of Spain by the Inquisition, and went to Venice. In 1748, his\\ngrandfather came to England. His father was Isaac Disraeli, well known as\\na literary man. Benjamin was born in London, and received his early\\neducation under his father. He afterwards studied for a lawyer, but soon\\ngave up his profession for literature. His first novel, \"Vivian Grey,\"\\nappeared when the author was twenty-one years of age; it received much\\nattention. After several defeats he succeeded in an election to\\nParliament, and took his seat in that body, in the first year of\\nVictoria\\'s reign. On his first attempt to speak in Parliament, the House\\nrefused to hear him. It is said that, as he sat down, he remarked that the\\ntime would come when they would hear him. In 1849, he became the leader of\\nthe Conservative party in the House. During the administration of W. E.\\nGladstone, Mr. Disraeli was leader of the opposition. In 1868, he became\\nprime minister, holding the office for a short time. In 1874, he was again\\nappointed to the same office, where he remained until 1880. His wife was\\nmade Viscountess of Beaconsfield in 1868. After her death, the title of\\nEarl of Beaconsfield was conferred on Disraeli. He ranked among the most\\neminent, statesmen of the age, but always devoted a portion of his time to\\nliterature. \"Lothair,\" a novel, was published in 1870.\\n###\\n\\n\\n* * * They looked round on every side, and hope gave way before the scene\\nof desolation. Immense branches were shivered from the largest trees;\\nsmall ones were entirely stripped of their leaves; the long grass was\\nbowed to the earth; the waters were whirled in eddies out of the little\\nrivulets; birds, leaving their nests to seek shelter in the crevices of\\nthe rocks, unable to stem the driving air, flapped their wings and fell\\nupon the earth; the frightened animals of the plain, almost suffocated by\\nthe impetuosity of the wind, sought safety and found destruction; some of\\nthe largest trees were torn up by the roots; the sluices of the mountains\\nwere filled, and innumerable torrents rushed down the before empty\\ngullies. The heavens now open, and the lightning and thunder contend with\\nthe horrors of the wind.\\n\\nIn a moment, all was again hushed. Dead silence succeeded the bellow of\\nthe thunder, the roar of the wind, the rush of the waters, the moaning of\\nthe beasts, the screaming of the birds. Nothing was heard save the plash\\nof the agitated lake, as it beat up against the black rocks which girt it\\nin.\\n\\nAgain, greater darkness enveloped the trembling earth. Anon, the heavens\\nwere rent with lightning, which nothing could have quenched but the\\ndescending deluge. Cataracts poured down from the lowering firmament. For\\nan instant, the horses dashed madly forward; beast and rider blinded and\\nstifled by the gushing rain, and gasping for breath. Shelter was nowhere.\\nThe quivering beasts reared, and snorted, and sank upon their knees,\\ndismounting their riders.\\n\\nHe had scarcely spoken, when there burst forth a terrific noise, they knew\\nnot what; a rush, they could not understand; a vibration which shook them\\non their horses. Every terror sank before the roar of the cataract. It\\nseemed that the mighty mountain, unable to support its weight of waters,\\nshook to the foundation. A lake had burst upon its summit, and the\\ncataract became a falling ocean. The source of the great deep appeared to\\nbe discharging itself over the range of mountains; the great gray peak\\ntottered on its foundation!--It shook!--it fell!  and buried in its ruins\\nthe castle, the village, and the bridge!\\n\\n\\n\\nV. AFTER THE THUNDERSTORM. (72)\\n\\nJames Thomson, 1700-1748, the son of a clergyman, was born in Scotland. He\\nstudied at the University of Edinburgh, and intended to follow the\\nprofession of his father, but never entered upon the duties of the sacred\\noffice. In 1724 he went to London, where he spent most of his subsequent\\nlife. He had shown some poetical talent when it boy; and, in 1826, he\\npublished \"Winter,\" a part of a longer poem, entitled \"The Seasons,\" the\\nbest known of all his works. He also wrote several plays for the stage;\\nnone of them, however, achieved any great success. In the last year of his\\nlife, he published his \"Castle of Indolence,\" the most famous of his works\\nexcepting \"The Seasons.\" Thomson was heavy and dull in his personal\\nappearance, and was indolent in his habits.

HOUSE CLEANING. (73)\\n\\nFrancis Hopkinson, 1737-1791. He was the son of an Englishman; born in\\nPhiladelphia, and was educated at the college of that city, now the\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He represented New Jersey in the Congress of\\n1776, and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He\\nwas one of the most sensible and elegant writers of his time, and\\ndistinguished himself both in prose and verse. His lighter writings abound\\nin humor and keen satire; his more solid writings are marked by clearness\\nand good sense. His pen did much to forward the cause of American\\nindependence. His \"Essay on Whitewashing,\" from which the following\\nextract is taken, was mistaken for the composition of Dr. Franklin, and\\npublished among his writings, It was originally in the form of \"A Letter\\nfrom a Gentleman in America to his Friend in Europe, on Whitewashing.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nThere is no season of the year in which the lady may not, if she pleases,\\nclaim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally fixed upon for\\nthe purpose. The attentive husband may judge, by certain prognostics, when\\nthe storm is at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly fretful, finds fault\\nwith the servants, is discontented with the children, and complains much\\nof the nastiness of everything about her, these are symptoms which ought\\nnot to be neglected, yet they sometimes go off without any further effect.\\n\\n\\nBut if, when the husband rises in the morning, he should observe in the\\nyard a wheelbarrow with a quantity of lime in it, or should see certain\\nbuckets filled with a solution of lime in water, there is no time for\\nhesitation. He immediately locks up the apartment or closet where his\\npapers and private property are kept, and, putting the key into his\\npocket, betakes himself to flight. A husband, however beloved, becomes a\\nperfect nuisance during this season of female rage. His authority is\\nsuperseded, his commission suspended, and the very scullion who cleans the\\nbrasses in the kitchen becomes of more importance than he. He has nothing\\nfor it but to abdicate for a time, and run from an evil which he can\\nneither prevent nor mollify.\\n\\nThe husband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are stripped of their\\nfurniture--paintings, prints, and looking-glasses lie huddled in heaps\\nabout the floors; the curtains are torn from their testers, the beds\\ncrammed into windows, chairs and tables, bedsteads and cradles, crowd the\\nyard, and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets,\\ncloth cloaks, old coats, under petticoats, and ragged breeches. Here may\\nbe seen the lumber of the kitchen, forming a dark and confused mass for\\nthe foreground of the picture; gridirons and frying pans, rusty shovels\\nand broken tongs, joint stools, and the fractured remains of rush-bottomed\\nchairs. There a closet has disgorged its bowels--riveted plates and\\ndishes, halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, broken wineglasses,\\nphials of forgotten physic, papers of unknown powders, seeds and dried\\nherbs, tops of teapots, and stoppers of departed decanters--from the rag\\nhole in the garret, to the rat hole in the cellar, no place escapes\\nunrummaged. It would seem as if the day of general doom had come, and the\\nutensils of the house were dragged forth to judgment.\\n\\nIn this tempest, the words of King Lear unavoidably present themselves,\\nand might, with little alteration, be made strictly applicable.\\n\\n\\n  \"Let the great gods,\\n  That keep this dreadful pother o\\'er our heads,\\n  Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,\\n  That hast within thee undivulged crimes\\n  Unwhipp\\'d of justice.\\n                       Close pent-up guilts,\\n  Rive your concealing continents, and cry\\n  These dreadful summoners grace.\"\\n\\n\\nThis ceremony completed, and the house thoroughly evacuated, the next\\noperation is to smear the walls and ceilings with brushes dipped into a\\nsolution of lime, called whitewash; to pour buckets of water over every\\nfloor; and scratch all the partitions and wainscots with hard brushes,\\ncharged with soft soap and stonecutters\\' sand.\\n\\nThe windows by no means escape the general deluge. A servant scrambles out\\nupon the penthouse, at the risk of her neck, and, with a mug in her hand\\nand a bucket within reach, dashes innumerable gallons of water against the\\nglass panes, to the great annoyance of passengers in the street.\\n\\nI have been told that an action at law was once brought against one of\\nthese water nymphs, by a person who had a new suit of clothes spoiled by\\nthis operation: but after long argument, it was determined that no damages\\ncould be awarded; inasmuch as the defendant was in the exercise of a legal\\nright, and not answerable for the consequences. And so the poor gentleman\\nwas doubly non-suited; for he lost both his suit of clothes and his suit\\nat law.\\n\\nThese smearings and scratchings, these washings and dashings, being duly\\nperformed, the next ceremonial is to cleanse and replace the distracted\\nfurniture. You may have seen a house raising, or a ship launch--\\nrecollect, if you can, the hurry, bustle, confusion, and noise of such a\\nscene, and you will have some idea of this cleansing match. The misfortune\\nis, that the sole object is to make things clean. It matters not how many\\nuseful, ornamental, or valuable articles suffer mutilation or death under\\nthe operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame undergo the same\\ndiscipline; they are to be made clean at all events; but their\\npreservation is not worthy of attention.\\n\\nFor instance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a number\\nof smaller prints are piled upon it, until the superincumbent weight\\ncracks the lower glass--but this is of no importance. A valuable picture\\nis placed leaning against the sharp corner of a table; others are made to\\nlean against that, till the pressure of the whole forces the corner of the\\ntable through the canvas of the first. The frame and glass of a fine print\\nare to be cleaned; the spirit and oil used on this occasion are suffered\\nto leak through and deface the engraving--no matter. If the glass is clean\\nand the frame shines, it is sufficient--the rest is not worthy of\\nconsideration. An able arithmetician hath made a calculation, founded on\\nlong experience, and proved that the losses and destruction incident to\\ntwo white washings are equal to one removal, and three removals equal to\\none fire.\\n\\nThis cleansing frolic over, matters begin to resume their pristine\\nappearance: the storm abates, and all would be well again; but it is\\nimpossible that so great a convulsion in so small a community should pass\\nover without producing some consequences. For two or three weeks after the\\noperation, the family are usually afflicted with sore eyes, sore throats,\\nor severe colds, occasioned by exhalations from wet floors and damp walls.\\n\\n\\nI know a gentleman here who is fond of accounting for everything in a\\nphilosophical way. He considers this, what I call a custom, as a real\\nperiodical disease peculiar to the climate. His train of reasoning is\\nwhimsical and ingenious, but I am not at leisure to give you the detail.\\nThe result was, that he found the distemper to be incurable; but after\\nmuch study, he thought he had discovered a method to divert the evil he\\ncould not subdue. For this purpose, he caused a small building, about\\ntwelve feet square, to be erected in his garden, and furnished with some\\nordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheapest sort. His\\nhope was, that when the whitewashing frenzy seized the females of his\\nfamily, they might repair to this apartment, and scrub, and scour, and\\nsmear to their hearts\\' content; and so spend the violence of the disease\\nin this outpost, whilst he enjoyed himself in quiet at headquarters. But\\nthe experiment did not answer his expectation. It was impossible it\\nshould, since a principal part of the gratification consists in the lady\\'s\\nhaving an uncontrolled right to torment her husband at least once in every\\nyear; to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of government into her\\nown hands.\\n\\nThere is a much better contrivance than this of the philosopher\\'s; which\\nis, to cover the walls of the house with paper. This is generally done.\\nAnd though it does not abolish, it at least shortens the period of female\\ndominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies; and made so\\nornamental that the women have admitted the fashion without perceiving the\\ndesign.\\n\\nThere is also another alleviation to the husband\\'s distress. He generally\\nhas the sole use of a small room or closet for his books and papers, the\\nkey of which he is allowed to keep. This is considered as a privileged\\nplace, even in the whitewashing season, and stands like the land of Goshen\\namidst the plagues of Egypt. But then he must be extremely cautious, and\\never upon his guard; for, should he inadvertently go abroad and leave the\\nkey in his door, the housemaid, who is always on the watch for such an\\nopportunity, immediately enters in triumph with buckets, brooms, and\\nbrushes--takes possession of the premises, and forthwith puts an his books\\nand papers \"to rights,\" to his utter confusion, and sometimes serious\\ndetriment.\\n\\nNotes.--Lear.--The reference is to Shakespeare\\'s tragedy, Act III, Scene\\n2.\\n\\nGoshen.--The portion of Egypt settled by Jacob and his family. In the\\nBible, Exodus viii, 22, Goshen was exempted from the plague of the flies.\\n\\nThe teacher should ascertain that the pupils note the satire and humor of\\nthis selection.\\n\\nThis letter was written about a hundred years ago. What word in the first\\nparagraph that would probably not be used by an elegant writer of the\\npresent day? Note the words that indicate changes in domestic customs;\\nsuch as testers, joint stools, wainscots, house raising.\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. SCHEMES OF LIFE OFTEN ILLUSORY. (78)\\n\\nSamuel Johnson, 1700-1784. This truly remarkable man was the son of a\\nbookseller and stationer; he was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire,\\nEngland. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but, at the end of\\nthree years, his poverty compelled him to leave without taking his degree.\\nIn 1736, he married Mrs. Porter, a widow of little culture, much older\\nthan himself, but possessed of some property. The marriage seems to have\\nbeen a happy one, nevertheless; and, on the death of his wife, in 1752,\\nJohnson mourned for her, most sincerely. Soon after his marriage, he\\nopened a private school, but, obtained only three pupils, one of whom was\\nDavid Garrick, afterward the celebrated actor. In 1737, he removed to\\nLondon, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. Here he\\nentered upon literary work, in which he continued, and from which he\\nderived his chief support, although at times it was but a meager one, His\\n\"Vanity of Human Wishes\" was sold for ten guineas. His great Dictionary,\\nthe first one of the English language worthy of mention, brought him\\n1575 Pounds, and occupied his time for seven years. Most of the money he\\nreceived for the work went to pay his six amanuenses. The other most\\nfamous of his numerous literary works are \"The Rambler,\" \"Rasselas,\" \"The\\nLives of the English Poets,\" and his edition of Shakespeare. In person,\\nJohnson was heavy and awkward; he was the victim of scrofula in his youth,\\nand of dropsy in his old age. In manner, he was boorish and overbearing;\\nbut his great powers and his wisdom caused his company to be sought by\\nmany eminent men of his time.\\n###\\n\\n\\nOmar, the son of Hassan, had passed seventy-five years in honor and\\nprosperity. The favor of three successive caliphs had filled his house\\nwith gold and silver; and whenever he appeared, the benedictions of the\\npeople proclaimed his passage.\\n\\nTerrestrial happiness is of short continuance, The brightness of the flame\\nis wasting its fuel; the fragrant flower is passing away in its own odors.\\nThe vigor of Omar began to fail; the curls of beauty fell from his head;\\nstrength departed from his hands, and agility from his feet. He gave back\\nto the caliph the keys of trust, and the seals of secrecy; and sought no\\nother pleasure for the remainder of life than the converse of the wise and\\nthe gratitude of the good.\\n\\nThe powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by\\nvisitants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to pay\\nthe tribute of admiration. Caleb, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, entered\\nevery day early, and retired late. He was beautiful and eloquent; Omar\\nadmired his wit, and loved his docility.\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" said Caleb, \"thou to whose voice nations have listened, and\\nwhose wisdom is known to the extremities of Asia, tell me, how I may\\nresemble Omar the prudent? The arts by which thou hast gained power and\\npreserved it, are to thee no longer necessary or useful; impart to me the\\nsecret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy wisdom has\\nbuilt thy fortune.\"\\n\\n\"Young man,\" said Omar, \"it is of little use to form plans of life. When I\\ntook my first survey of the world, in my twentieth year, having considered\\nthe various conditions of mankind, in the hour of solitude I said thus to\\nmyself, leaning against a cedar which spread its branches over my head:\\n\\'Seventy years are allowed to man; I have yet fifty remaining.\\n\\n\" \\'Ten years I will allot to the attainment of knowledge, and ten I will\\npass in foreign countries; I shall be learned, and therefore I shall be\\nhonored; every city will shout at my arrival, and every student will\\nsolicit my friendship. Twenty years thus passed will store my mind with\\nimages which I shall be busy through the rest of my life in combining and\\ncomparing. I shall revel in inexhaustible accumulations of intellectual\\nriches; I shall find new pleasures for every moment, and shall never more\\nbe weary of myself.\\n\\n\" \\'I will not, however, deviate too far from the beaten track of life; but\\nwill try what can be found in female delicacy. I will marry a wife as\\nbeautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide; and with her I will live\\ntwenty years within the suburbs of Bagdad, in every pleasure that wealth\\ncan purchase, and fancy can invent.\\n\\n\" \\'I will then retire to a rural dwelling, pass my days in obscurity and\\ncontemplation; and lie silently down on the bed of death. Through my life\\nit shall be my settled resolution, that I will never depend on the smile\\nof princes; that I will never stand exposed to the artifices of courts; I\\nwill never pant for public honors, nor disturb my quiet with the affairs\\nof state.\\' Such was my scheme of life, which I impressed indelibly upon my\\nmemory.\\n\\n\"The first part of my ensuing time was to be spent in search of knowledge,\\nand I know not how I was diverted from my design. I had no visible\\nimpediments without, nor any ungovernable passion within. I regarded\\nknowledge as the highest honor, and the most engaging pleasure; yet day\\nstole upon day, and month glided after month, till I found that seven\\nyears of the first ten had vanished, and left nothing behind them.\\n\\n\"I now postponed my purpose of traveling; for why should I go abroad,\\nwhile so much remained to be learned at home? I immured myself for four\\nyears, and studied the laws of the empire. The fame of my skill reached\\nthe judges: I was found able to speak upon doubtful questions, and I was\\ncommanded to stand at the footstool of the caliph. I was heard with\\nattention; I was consulted with confidence, and the love of praise\\nfastened on my heart.\\n\\n\"I still wished to see distant countries; listened with rapture to the\\nrelations of travelers, and resolved some time to ask my dismission, that\\nI might feast my soul with novelty; but my presence was always necessary,\\nand the stream of business hurried me along. Sometimes, I was afraid lest\\nI should be charged with ingratitude; but I still proposed to travel, and\\ntherefore would not confine myself by marriage.\\n\\n\"In my fiftieth year, I began to suspect that the time of my traveling was\\npast; and thought it best to lay hold on the felicity yet in my power, and\\nindulge myself in domestic pleasures. But, at fifty, no man easily finds a\\nwoman beautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide. I inquired and\\nrejected, consulted and deliberated, till the sixty-second year made me\\nashamed of wishing to marry. I had now nothing left but retirement; and\\nfor retirement I never found a time, till disease forced me from public\\nemployment.\\n\\n\"Such was my scheme, and such has been its consequence. With an insatiable\\nthirst for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a\\nrestless desire of seeing different countries, I have always resided in\\nthe same city; with the highest expectation of connubial felicity, I have\\nlived unmarried; and with an unalterable resolution of contemplative\\nretirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdad.\"\\n\\n\\nNotes.--Bag dad\\'--A large city of Asiatic Turkey, on the river Tigris.\\n\\nIn the ninth century, it was the greatest center of Moslem power and\\nlearning.\\n\\nZobeide (Zo-bad\\').--A lady of Bagdad, whose story is given in the \"Three\\nCalendars\" of the \"Arabian Nights.\"\\n\\nIn this selection the form of an allegory is used to express a general\\ntruth.\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. THE BRAVE OLD OAK. (81)\\n\\nHenry Fothergill Chorley, 1808-1872. He is known chiefly as a musical\\ncritic and author; for thirty-eight years he was connected with the\\n\"London Athenaeum.\" His books are mostly novels.\\n###\\n\\n\\nA song to the oak, the brave old oak,\\n  Who hath ruled in the greenwood long;\\nHere\\'s health and renown to his broad green crown,\\n  And his fifty arms so strong.\\nThere\\'s fear in his frown, when the sun goes down,\\n  And the fire in the west fades out;\\nAnd he showeth his might on a wild midnight,\\n  When the storms through his branches shout.\\n\\nIn the days of old, when the spring with cold\\n  Had brightened his branches gray,\\nThrough the grass at his feet, crept maidens sweet,\\n  To gather the dews of May.\\nAnd on that day, to the rebec gay\\n  They frolicked with lovesome swains;\\nThey are gone, they are dead, in the churchyard laid,\\n  But the tree--it still remains.\\n\\nHe saw rare times when the Christmas chimes\\n  Were a merry sound to hear,\\nWhen the Squire\\'s wide hall and the cottage small\\n  Were filled with good English cheer.\\nNow gold hath the sway we all obey,\\n  And a ruthless king is he;\\nBut he never shall send our ancient friend\\n  To be tossed on the stormy sea.\\n\\nThen here\\'s to the oak, the brave old oak,\\n  Who stands in his pride alone;\\nAnd still flourish he, a hale green tree,\\n  When a hundred years are gone.\\n\\n\\nIX. THE ARTIST SURPRISED. (82)\\n\\nIt may not be known to all the admirers of the genius of Albert Durer,\\nthat that famous engraver was endowed with a \"better half,\" so peevish in\\ntemper, that she was the torment not only of his own life, but also of his\\npupils and domestics. Some of the former were cunning enough to purchase\\npeace for themselves by conciliating the common tyrant, but woe to those\\nunwilling or unable to offer aught in propitiation. Even the wiser ones\\nwere spared only by having their offenses visited upon a scapegoat.\\n\\nThis unfortunate individual was Samuel Duhobret, a disciple whom Durer had\\nadmitted into his school out of charity. He was employed in painting signs\\nand the coarser tapestry then used in Germany. He was about forty years of\\nage, little, ugly, and humpbacked; he was the butt of every ill joke among\\nhis fellow disciples, and was picked out as an object of especial dislike\\nby Madame Durer. But he bore all with patience, and ate, without\\ncomplaint, the scanty crusts given him every day for dinner, while his\\ncompanions often fared sumptuously.\\n\\nPoor Samuel had not a spice of envy or malice in his heart. He would, at\\nany time, have toiled half the night to assist or serve those who were\\nwont oftenest to laugh at him, or abuse him loudest for his stupidity.\\nTrue, he had not the qualities of social humor or wit, but he was an\\nexample of indefatigable industry. He came to his studies every morning at\\ndaybreak, and remained at work until sunset. Then he retired into his\\nlonely chamber, and wrought for his own amusement.\\n\\nDuhobret labored three years in this way, giving himself no time for\\nexercise or recreation. He said nothing to a single human being of the\\npaintings he had produced in the solitude of his cell, by the light of his\\nlamp. But his bodily energies wasted and declined under incessant toil.\\nThere was none sufficiently interested in the poor artist, to mark the\\nfeverish hue of his wrinkled cheek, or the increasing attenuation of his\\nmisshapen frame.\\n\\nNone observed that the uninviting pittance set aside for his midday\\nrepast, remained for several days untouched. Samuel made his appearance\\nregularly as ever, and bore with the same meekness the gibes of his\\nfellow-pupils, or the taunts of Madame Durer, and worked with the same\\nuntiring assiduity, though his hands would sometimes tremble, and his eyes\\nbecome suffused, a weakness probably owing to the excessive use he had\\nmade of them.\\n\\nOne morning Duhobret was missing at the scene of his daily labors. His\\nabsence created much remark, and many were the jokes passed upon the\\noccasion. One surmised this, and another that, as the cause of the\\nphenomenon; and it was finally agreed that the poor fellow must have\\nworked himself into an absolute skeleton, and taken his final stand in the\\nglass frame of some apothecary, or been blown away by a puff of wind,\\nwhile his door happened to stand open. No on thought of going to his\\nlodgings to look after him or his remains.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the object of their mirth was tossing on a bed of sickness.\\nDisease, which had been slowly sapping the foundations of his strength,\\nburned in every vein; his eyes rolled and flashed in delirium; his lips,\\nusually so silent, muttered wild and incoherent words. In his days of\\nhealth, poor Duhobret had his dreams, as all artists, rich or poor, will\\nsometimes have. He had thought that the fruit of many years\\' labor,\\ndisposed of to advantage, might procure him enough to live, in an\\neconomical way, for the rest of his life. He never anticipated fame or\\nfortune; the height of his ambition or hope was, to possess a tenement\\nlarge enough to shelter him from the inclemencies of the weather, with\\nmeans enough to purchase one comfortable meal per day.\\n\\nNow, alas! however, even that one hope had deserted him. He thought\\nhimself dying, and thought it hard to die without one to look kindly upon\\nhim, without the words of comfort that might soothe his passage to another\\nworld. He fancied his bed surrounded by fiendish faces, grinning at his\\nsufferings, and taunting his inability to summon power to disperse them.\\nAt length the apparition faded away, and the patient sunk into an\\nexhausted slumber.\\n\\nHe awoke unrefreshed; it was the fifth day he had lain there neglected.\\nHis mouth was parched; he turned over, and feebly stretched out his hand\\ntoward the earthen pitcher, from which, since the first day of his illness\\nhe had quenched his thirst. Alas! it was empty! Samuel lay for a few\\nmoments thinking what he should do. He knew he must die of want if he\\nremained there alone; but to whom could he apply for aid?\\n\\nAn idea seemed, at last, to strike him. He arose slowly, and with\\ndifficulty, from the bed, went to the other side of the room, and took up\\nthe picture he had painted last. He resolved to carry it to the shop of a\\nsalesman, and hoped to obtain for it sufficient to furnish him with the\\nnecessaries of life for a week longer. Despair lent him strength to walk,\\nand to carry his burden. On his way, he passed a house, about which there\\nwas a crowd. He drew nigh, asked what was going on, and received for an\\nanswer, that there was to be a sale of many specimens of art, collected by\\nan amateur in the course of thirty years. It has often happened that\\ncollections made with infinite pains by the proprietor, have been sold\\nwithout mercy or discrimination after his death.\\n\\nSomething whispered to the weary Duhobret, that here would be the market\\nfor his picture. It was a long way yet to the house of the picture dealer,\\nand he made up his mind at once. He worked his way through the crowd,\\ndragged himself up the steps, and, after many inquiries, found the\\nauctioneer. That personage was a busy man, with a handful of papers; he\\nwas inclined to notice somewhat roughly the interruption of the lean,\\nsallow hunchback, imploring as were his gesture and language.\\n\\n\"What do you call your picture?\" at length, said he, carefully looking at\\nit.\\n\\n\"It is a view of the Abbey of Newburg, with its village and the\\nsurrounding landscape,\" replied the eager and trembling artist.\\n\\nThe auctioneer again scanned it contemptuously, and asked what it was\\nworth. \"Oh, that is what you please; whatever it will bring,\" answered\\nDuhobret.\\n\\n\"Hem! it is too odd to please, I should think; I can promise you no more\\nthan three thalers.\"\\n\\nPoor Samuel sighed deeply. He had spent on that piece the nights of many\\nmonths. But he was starving now; and the pitiful sum offered would give\\nbread for a few days. He nodded his head to the auctioneer, and retiring\\ntook his seat in a corner.\\n\\nThe sale began. After some paintings and engravings had been disposed of,\\nSamuel\\'s was exhibited. \"Who bids at three thalers? Who bids?\" was the\\ncry. Duhobret listened eagerly, but none answered. \"Will it find a\\npurchaser?\" said he despondingly, to himself. Still there was a dead\\nsilence. He dared not look up; for it seemed to him that all the people\\nwere laughing at the folly of the artist, who could be insane enough to\\noffer so worthless a piece at a public sale.\\n\\n\"What will become of me?\" was his mental inquiry. \"That work is certainly\\nmy best;\" and he ventured to steal another glance. \"Does it not seem that\\nthe wind actually stirs those boughs and moves those leaves! How\\ntransparent is the water! What life breathes in the animals that quench\\ntheir thirst at that spring! How that steeple shines! How beautiful are\\nthose clustering trees!\" This was the last expiring throb of an artist\\'s\\nvanity. The ominous silence continued, and Samuel, sick at heart, buried\\nhis face in his hands.\\n\\n\"Twenty-one thalers!\" murmured a faint voice, just as the auctioneer was\\nabout to knock down the picture. The stupefied painter gave a start of\\njoy. He raised his head and looked to see from whose lips those blessed\\nwords had come. It was the picture dealer, to whom he had first thought of\\napplying.\\n\\n\"Fifty thalers,\" cried a sonorous voice. This time a tall man in black was\\nthe speaker. There was a silence of hushed expectation. \"One hundred\\nthalers,\" at length thundered the picture dealer.\\n\\n\"Three hundred!\" \"Five hundred!\" \"One thousand!\" Another profound silence,\\nand the crowd pressed around the two opponents, who stood opposite each\\nother with eager and angry looks.\\n\\n\"Two thousand thalers!\" cried the picture dealer, and glanced around him\\ntriumphantly, when he saw his adversary hesitate. \"Ten thousand!\"\\nvociferated the tall man, his face crimson with rage, and his hands\\nclinched convulsively. The dealer grew paler; his frame shook with\\nagitation; he made two or three efforts, and at last cried out \"Twenty\\nthousand!\"\\n\\nHis tall opponent was not to be vanquished. He bid forty thousand. The\\ndealer stopped; the other laughed a low laugh of insolent triumph, and a\\nmurmur of admiration was heard in the crowd. It was too much for the\\ndealer; he felt his peace was at stake. \"Fifty thousand!\" exclaimed he in\\ndesperation. It was the tall man\\'s turn to hesitate. Again the whole crowd\\nwere breathless. At length, tossing his arms in defiance, he shouted \"One\\nhundred thousand!\" The crestfallen picture dealer withdrew; the tall man\\nvictoriously bore away the prize.\\n\\nHow was it, meanwhile, with Duhobret, while this exciting scene was going\\non? He was hardly master of his senses. He rubbed his eyes repeatedly, and\\nmurmured to himself, \"After such a dream, my misery will seem more cruel!\"\\nWhen the contest ceased, he rose up bewildered, and went about asking\\nfirst one, then another, the price of the picture just sold. It seemed\\nthat his apprehension could not at once be enlarged to so vast a\\nconception.\\n\\nThe possessor was proceeding homeward, when a decrepit, lame, and\\nhumpbacked invalid, tottering along by the aid of a stick, presented\\nhimself before him. He threw him a piece of money, and waved his hand as\\ndispensing with his thanks. \"May it please your honor,\" said the supposed\\nbeggar, \"I am the painter of that picture!\" and again he rubbed his eyes.\\n\\nThe tall mall was Count Dunkelsback, one of the richest noblemen in\\nGermany. He stopped, took out his pocketbook, took out a leaf, and wrote\\non it a few lines. \"Take it, friend,\" said he; \"it is a check for your\\nmoney. Adieu.\"\\n\\nDuhobret finally persuaded himself that it was not a dream. He became the\\nmaster of a castle, sold it, and resolved to live luxuriously for the rest\\nof his life, and to cultivate painting as a pastime. But, alas, for the\\nvanity of human expectation! He had borne privation and toil; prosperity\\nwas too much for him, as was proved soon after, when an indigestion\\ncarried him off. His picture remained long in the cabinet of Count\\nDunkelsback, and afterward passed into the possession of the King of\\nBavaria.\\n\\nNotes.--Albert Durer (b. 1471, d. 1528) lived at Nuremburg, Germany. He\\nwas eminent as a painter, and as an engraver on copper and wood. He was\\none of the first artists who studied anatomy and perspective. His\\ninfluence on art is clearly felt even at the present day.\\n\\nNewburg, or Neuburg, is on the Danube, fifty miles south of Nuremburg.\\nBergen Abbey was north of the village.\\n\\n\\n\\nX. PICTURES OF MEMORY. (88)\\n\\nAlice Cary, 1820-1871, was born near Cincinnati. One of her ancestors was\\namong the \"Pilgrim Fathers,\" and the first instructor of Latin at\\nPlymouth, Mass. Miss Cary commenced her literary career at her western\\nhome, and, in 1849, published a volume of poems, the joint work of her\\nyounger sister, Phoebe, and herself. In 1850, she moved to New York. Two\\nof her sisters joined her there, and they supported themselves by their\\nliterary labor. Their home became a noted resort for their literary and\\nartistic friends. Miss Cary was the author of eleven volumes, besides many\\narticles contributed to periodicals. Her poetry is marked with great\\nsweetness and pathos. Some of her prose works are much admired, especially\\nher \"Clovernook Children.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nAmong the beautiful pictures\\n  That hang on Memory\\'s wall,\\nIs one of a dim old forest,\\n  That seemeth best of all;\\nNot for its gnarled oaks olden,\\n  Dark with the mistletoe;\\nNot for the violets golden,\\n  That sprinkle the vale below;\\nNot for the milk-white lilies,\\n  That lean from the fragrant hedge,\\nCoquetting all day with the sunbeams,\\n  And stealing their golden edge;\\nNot for the vines on the upland,\\n  Where the bright red berries rest,\\nNor the pinks, nor the pale, sweet cowslip,\\n  It seemeth to me the best.\\n\\nI once had a little brother,\\n  With eyes that were dark and deep;\\nIn the lap of that dim old forest,\\n  He lieth in peace asleep:\\nLight as the down of the thistle,\\n  Free as the winds that blow,\\nWe roved there the beautiful summers,\\n  The summers of long ago;\\nBut his feet on the hills grew weary,\\n  And, one of the autumn eves,\\nI made for my little brother,\\n  A bed of the yellow leaves.\\n\\nSweetly his pale arms folded\\n  My neck in a meek embrace,\\nAs the light of immortal beauty\\n  Silently covered his face;\\nAnd when the arrows of sunset\\n  Lodged in the tree tops bright,\\nHe fell, in his saintlike beauty,\\n  Asleep by the gates of light.\\nTherefore, of all the pictures\\n  That hang on Memory\\'s wall,\\nThe one of the dim old forest\\n  Seemeth the best of all.\\n\\n\\n\\nXI. THE MORNING ORATORIO. (90)\\n\\nWilson Flagg, 1806-1884, was born in Beverly, Mass. He pursued his\\nacademical course in Andover, at Phillips Academy, and entered Harvard\\nCollege, but did not graduate. His chief Works are: \"Studies in the Field\\nand Forest,\" \"The Woods and Byways of New England,\" and \"The Birds and\\nSeasons of New England.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nNature, for the delight of waking eyes, has arrayed the morning heavens in\\nthe loveliest hues of beauty. Fearing to dazzle by an excess of delight,\\nshe first announces day by a faint and glimmering twilight, then sheds a\\npurple tint over the brows of the rising morn, and infuses a transparent\\nruddiness throughout the atmosphere. As daylight widens, successive groups\\nof mottled and rosy-bosomed clouds assemble on the gilded sphere, and,\\ncrowned with wreaths of fickle rainbows, spread a mirrored flush over\\nhill, grove, and lake, and every village spire is burnished with their\\nsplendor.\\n\\nAt length, through crimsoned vapors, we behold the sun\\'s broad disk,\\nrising with a countenance so serene that every eye may view him ere he\\narrays himself in his meridian brightness. Not many people who live in\\ntowns are aware of the pleasure attending a ramble near the woods and\\norchards at daybreak in the early part of summer. The drowsiness we feel\\non rising from our beds is gradually dispelled by the clear and healthful\\nbreezes of early day, and we soon experience an unusual amount of vigor\\nand elasticity.\\n\\nDuring the night, the stillness of all things is the circumstance that\\nmost powerfully attracts our notice, rendering us peculiarly sensitive to\\nevery accidental sound that meets the ear. In the morning, at this time of\\nyear, on the contrary, we are overpowered by the vocal and multitudinous\\nchorus of the feathered tribe. If you would hear the commencement of this\\ngrand anthem of nature, you must rise at the very first appearance of\\ndawn, before the twilight has formed a complete semicircle above the\\neastern porch of heaven.\\n\\nThe first note that proceeds from the little warbling host, is the shrill\\nchirp of the hairbird,--occasionally vocal at an hours on a warm summer\\nnight. This strain, which is a continued trilling sound, is repeated with\\ndiminishing intervals, until it becomes almost incessant. But ere the\\nhairbird has uttered many notes, a single robin begins to warble from a\\nneighboring orchard, soon followed by others, increasing in numbers until,\\nby the time the eastern sky is flushed with crimson, every male, robin in\\nthe country round is singing with fervor.\\n\\nIt would be difficult to note the exact order in which the different birds\\nsuccessively begin their parts in this performance; but the bluebird,\\nwhose song is only a short, mellow warble, is heard nearly at the same\\ntime with the robin, and the song sparrow joins them soon after with his\\nbrief but finely modulated strain. The different species follow rapidly,\\none after another, in the chorus, until the whole welkin rings with their\\nmatin hymn of gladness.\\n\\nI have often wondered that the almost simultaneous utterance of so many\\ndifferent notes should produce no discords, and that they should result in\\nsuch complete harmony. In this multitudinous confusion of voices, no two\\nnotes are confounded, and none has sufficient duration to grate harshly\\nwith a dissimilar sound. Though each performer sings only a few strains\\nand then makes a pause, the whole multitude succeed one another with such\\nrapidity that we hear an uninterrupted flow of music until the broad light\\nof day invites them to other employments.\\n\\nWhen there is just light enough to distinguish the birds, we may observe,\\nhere and there, a single swallow perched on the roof of a barn or shed,\\nrepeating two twittering notes incessantly, with a quick turn and a hop at\\nevery note he utters. It would seem to be the design of the bird to\\nattract the attention of his mate, and this motion seems to be made to\\nassist her in discovering his position. As soon as the light has tempted\\nhim to fly abroad, this twittering strain is uttered more like a continued\\nsong, as he flits rapidly through the air.\\n\\nBut at this later moment the purple martins have commenced their more\\nmelodious chattering, so loud as to attract for a while the most of our\\nattention. There is not a sound in nature so cheering and animating as the\\nsong of the purple martin, and none so well calculated to drive away\\nmelancholy. Though not one of the earliest voices to be heard, the chorus\\nis perceptibly more loud and effective when this bird has united with the\\nchoir.\\n\\nWhen the flush of the morning has brightened into vermilion, and the place\\nfrom which the sun is soon to emerge has attained a dazzling brilliancy,\\nthe robins are already less tuneful. They are now becoming busy in\\ncollecting food for their morning repast, and one by one they leave the\\ntrees, and may be seen hopping upon the tilled ground, in quest of the\\nworms and insects that, have crept out during the night from their\\nsubterranean retreats.\\n\\nBut as the robins grow silent, the bobolinks begin their vocal revelries;\\nand to a fanciful mind it might seem that the robins had gradually\\nresigned their part in the performance to the bobolinks, not one of which\\nis heard until some of the former have concluded their songs. The little\\nhairbird still continues his almost incessant chirping, the first to begin\\nand the last to quit the performance. Though the voice of this bird is not\\nvery sweetly modulated, it blends harmoniously with the notes of other\\nbirds, and greatly increases the charming effect of the combination.\\n\\nIt would be tedious to name all the birds that take part in this chorus;\\nbut we must not omit the pewee, with his melancholy ditty, occasionally\\nheard like a short minor strain in an oratorio; nor the oriole, who is\\nreally one of the chief performers, and who, as his bright plumage flashes\\nupon the sight, warbles forth a few notes so clear and mellow as to be\\nbeard above every other sound. Adding a pleasing variety to all this\\nharmony, the lisping notes of the meadowlark, uttered in a shrill tone,\\nand with a peculiar pensive modulation, are plainly audible, with short\\nrests between each repetition.\\n\\nThere is a little brown sparrow, resembling the hairbird, save a general\\ntint of russet in his plumage, that may be heard distinctly among the\\nwarbling host. He is rarely seen in cultivated grounds, but frequents the\\nwild pastures, and is the bird that warbles so sweetly at midsummer, when\\nthe whortleberries are ripe, and the fields are beautifully spangled with\\nred lilies.\\n\\nThere is no confusion in the notes of his song, which consists of one\\nsyllable rapidly repeated, but increasing in rapidity and rising to a\\nhigher key towards the conclusion. He sometimes prolongs his strain, when\\nhis notes are observed to rise and fall in succession. These plaintive and\\nexpressive notes are very loud and constantly uttered, during the hour\\nthat precedes the rising of the sun. A dozen warblers of this species,\\nsinging in concert, and distributed in different parts of the field, form,\\nperhaps, the most delightful part of the woodland oratorio to which we\\nhave listened.\\n\\nAt sunrise hardly a robin can be beard in the whole neighborhood, and the\\ncharacter of the performance has completely changed during the last half\\nhour. The first part was more melodious and tranquilizing, the last is\\nmore brilliant and animating. The grass finches, the vireos, the wrens,\\nand the linnets have joined their voices to the chorus, and the bobolinks\\nare loudest in their song. But the notes of the birds in general are not\\nso incessant as before sunrise. One by one they discontinue their lays,\\nuntil at high noon the bobolink and the warbling flycatcher are almost the\\nonly vocalists to be heard in the fields.\\n\\n\\n\\nXII. SHORT SELECTIONS IN POETRY. (94)\\n\\n1. THE CLOUD.\\n\\nA cloud lay cradled near the setting sun,\\n  A gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow;\\nLong had I watched the glory moving on,\\n  O\\'er the still radiance of the lake below:\\n  Tranquil its spirit seemed, and floated slow,\\nE\\'en in its very motion there was rest,\\n  While every breath of eve that chanced to blow,\\nWafted the traveler to the beauteous west.\\nEmblem, methought, of the departed soul,\\n  To whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given,\\nAnd by the breath of mercy made to roll\\n  Right onward to the golden gate of heaven,\\nWhile to the eye of faith it peaceful lies,\\nAnd tells to man his glorious destinies.\\n                                          --John Wilson\\n\\n\\nII. MY MIND.\\n\\nMy mind to me a kingdom is;\\n  Such perfect joy therein I find,\\nAs far exceeds all earthly bliss\\n  That God or nature hath assigned;\\nThough much I want that most would have,\\nYet still my mind forbids to crave.\\n\\nNOTE.--This is the first stanza of a poem by William Byrd (b, 1543, d.\\n1623), an English composer of music.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. A GOOD NAME. (95)\\n\\nGood name, in man or woman, dear my lord,\\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\\nWho steals my purse, steals trash; \\'tis something, nothing;\\n\\'Twas mine, \\'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;\\nBut he that filches from me my good name,\\nRobs me of that which not enriches him,\\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\\n                             Shakespeare.--Othello, Act III, Scene III.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. SUNRISE.\\n\\nBut yonder comes the powerful king of day,\\nRejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud,\\nThe kindling azure, and the mountain\\'s brow\\nIllumed with liquid gold, his near approach\\nBetoken glad. Lo! now apparent all,\\nAslant the dew-bright earth and colored air\\nHe looks in boundless majesty abroad,\\nAnd sheds the shining day that, burnished, plays\\nOn rocks, and hills, and towers, and wandering streams,\\nHigh gleaming from afar.\\n                                                        Thomson.\\n\\n\\n\\nV. OLD AGE AND DEATH. (95)\\n\\nEdmund Waller, 1605-1687, an English poet, was a cousin of John Hampden,\\nand related to Oliver Cromwell. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge.\\nWaller was for many years a member of Parliament. He took part in the\\ncivil war, and was detected in a treasonable plot. Several years of his\\nlife were spent in exile in France. After the Restoration he came into\\nfavor at court. His poetry is celebrated for smoothness and sweetness, but\\nis disfigured by affected conceits.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  The seas are quiet when the winds give o\\'er;\\n  So calm are we when passions are no more.\\n  For then we know how vain it was to boast\\n  Of fleeting things, too certain to be lost.\\n  Clouds of affection from our younger eyes\\n  Conceal that emptiness which age descries.\\n  The soul\\'s dark cottage, battered and decayed,\\n  Lets in new light through chinks that time has made:\\n  Stronger by weakness, wiser men become,\\n  As they draw near to their eternal home.\\n  Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,\\n  That stand upon the threshold of the new.\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. MILTON. (96)\\n\\nJohn Dryden, 1631-1703, was a noted English writer, who was made poet\\nlaureate by James II. On the expulsion of James, and the accession of\\nWilliam and Mary, Dryden lost his offices and pension, and was compelled\\nto earn his bread by literary work. It was during these last years of his\\nlife that his best work was done. His \"Ode for St. Cecilia\\'s Day\" is one\\nof his most, celebrated poems. His prose writings are specimens of good,\\nstrong English.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  Three poets, in three distant ages born,\\n  Greece, Italy, and England did adorn;\\n  The first in loftiness of thought surpassed,\\n  The next in majesty, in both the last.\\n  The force of nature could no further go;\\n  To make a third she joined the other two.\\n\\nNote.--The two poets referred to, other than Milton, are Homer and Dante.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII. DEATH OF LITTLE NELL. (96)\\n\\nCharles Dickens. 1812-1870, one of the greatest novelists of modern,\\ntimes, was born in Portsmouth, but spent nearly all his life in London.\\nHis father was a conscientious man, but lacked capacity for getting a\\nlivelihood. In consequence, the boy\\'s youth was much darkened by poverty.\\nIt has been supposed that he pictured his father in the character of\\n\"Micawber.\" He began his active life as a lawyer\\'s apprentice; but soon\\nleft this employment to become a reporter. This occupation he followed\\nfrom 1831 to 1836. His first book was entitled \"Sketches of London\\nSociety, by Boz.\" This was followed, in 1837, by the \"Pickwick Papers,\" a\\nwork which suddenly brought much fame to the author. His other works\\nfollowed with great rapidity, and his last was unfinished at the time of\\nhis death. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens visited America\\nin 1842, and again in 1867. During his last visit, he read his works in\\npublic, in the principal cities of the United States.\\n\\nThe resources of Dickens\\'s genius seemed exhaustless. He copied no author,\\nimitated none, but relied entirely on his own powers. He excelled\\nespecially in humor and pathos. He gathered materials for his works by the\\nmost careful and faithful observation. And he painted his characters with\\na fidelity so true to their different individualities that, although they\\nsometimes have a quaint grotesqueness bordering on caricature, they stand\\nbefore the memory as living realities. He was particularly successful in\\nthe delineation of the joys and griefs of childhood. \"Little Nell\" and\\nlittle \"Paul Dombey\" are known, and have been loved and wept over, in\\nalmost every household where the English language is read. His writings\\npresent very vividly the wants and sufferings of the poor, and have a\\ntendency to prompt to kindness and benevolence. His works have not escaped\\ncriticism. It has been said that \"his good characters act from impulse,\\nnot from principle,\" and that he shows \"a tricksy spirit of fantastic\\nexaggeration.\" It has also been said that his novels sometimes lack\\nskillful plot, and that he seems to speak approvingly of conviviality and\\ndissipation. \"The Old Curiosity Shop,\" from which the following extract is\\ntaken, was published in 1840.\\n###\\n\\n\\nShe was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of pain,\\nso fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God,\\nand waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived, and suffered\\ndeath. Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and\\ngreen leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor. \"When I die,\\nput near me something that has loved the light, and had the sky above it\\nalways.\" These were her words.\\n\\nShe was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her little bird,\\na poor, slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed, was\\nstirring nimbly in its cage, and the strong heart of its child mistress\\nwas mute and motionless forever! Where were the traces of her early cares,\\nher sufferings, and fatigues? All gone. Sorrow was dead, indeed, in her;\\nbut peace and perfect happiness were born, imaged in her tranquil beauty\\nand profound repose.\\n\\nAnd still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change. Yes! the\\nold fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed, like a\\ndream, through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the poor\\nschoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire upon the cold\\nwet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had been the same\\nmild and lovely look. So shall we know the angels, in their majesty, after\\ndeath.\\n\\nThe old man held one languid arm in his, and had the small hand tight\\nfolded to his breast for warmth. It was the hand she had stretched out to\\nhim with her last smile; the hand that had led him on through all their\\nwanderings. Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips; then hugged it to his\\nbreast again, murmuring that it was warmer now, and, as he said it, he\\nlooked in agony to those who stood around, as if imploring them to help\\nher.\\n\\nShe was dead, and past all help, or need of help. The ancient rooms she\\nhad seemed to fill with life, even while her own was waning fast, the\\ngarden she had tended, the eyes she had gladdened, the noiseless haunts of\\nmany a thoughtful hour, the paths she had trodden, as it were, but\\nyesterday, could know her no more.\\n\\n\"It is not,\" said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the\\ncheek, and gave his tears free vent, \"it is not in this world that\\nheaven\\'s justice ends. Think what earth is, compared with the world to\\nwhich her young spirit has winged its early flight, and say, if one\\ndeliberate wish, expressed in solemn tones above this bed, could call her\\nback to life, which of us would utter it?\"\\n\\nShe had been dead two days. They were all about her at the time, knowing\\nthat the end was drawing on. She died soon after daybreak. They had read\\nand talked to her in the earlier portion of the night; but, as the hours\\ncrept on, she sank to sleep. They could tell by what she faintly uttered\\nin her dreams, that they were of her journeyings with the old man; they\\nwere of no painful scenes, but of people who had helped them, and used\\nthem kindly; for she often said \"God bless you!\" with great fervor.\\n\\nWaking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and that was at beautiful\\nmusic, which, she said, was in the air. God knows. It may have been.\\nOpening her eyes, at last, from a very quiet sleep, she begged that they\\nwould kiss her once again. That done, she turned to the old man, with a\\nlovely smile upon her face, such, they said, as they had never seen, and\\ncould never forget, and clung, with both her arms, about his neck. She had\\nnever murmured or complained; but, with a quiet mind, and manner quite\\nunaltered, save that she every day became more earnest and more grateful\\nto them, faded like the light upon the summer\\'s evening.\\n\\nThe child who had been her little friend, came there, almost as soon as it\\nwas day, with an offering of dried flowers, which he begged them to lay\\nupon her breast. He told them of his dream again, and that it was of her\\nbeing restored to them, just as she used to be. He begged hard to see her:\\nsaying, that he would be very quiet, and that they need not fear his being\\nalarmed, for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long, when he\\nwas dead, and had felt glad to be so near him. They let him have his wish;\\nand, indeed, he kept his word, and was, in his childish way, a lesson to\\nthem all.\\n\\nUp to that time, the old man had not spoken once, except to her, or\\nstirred from the bedside. But, when he saw her little favorite, he was\\nmoved as they had not seen him yet, and made as though he would have him\\ncome nearer. Then, pointing to the bed, he burst into tears for the first\\ntime, and they who stood by, knowing that the sight of this child had done\\nhim good, left them alone together.\\n\\nSoothing him with his artless talk of her, the child persuaded him to take\\nsome rest, to walk abroad, to do almost as he desired him. And, when the\\nday came, on which they must remove her, in her earthly shape, from\\nearthly eyes forever, he led him away, that he might not know when she was\\ntaken from him. They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed.\\n\\nAnd now the bell, the bell she had so often heard by night and day, and\\nlistened to with solemn pleasure, almost as a living voice, rung its\\nremorseless toll for her, so young, so beautiful, so good. Decrepit age,\\nand vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless infancy,--on crutches,\\nin the pride of health and strength, in the full blush of promise, in the\\nmere dawn of life, gathered round her. Old men were there, whose eyes were\\ndim and senses failing, grandmothers, who might have died ten years ago,\\nand still been old, the deaf, the blind, the lame, the palsied, the living\\ndead, in many shapes and forms, to see the closing of that early grave.\\n\\nAlong the crowded path they bore her now, pure as the newly fallen snow\\nthat covered it, whose day on earth had been as fleeting. Under that\\nporch, where she had sat when heaven, in its mercy, brought her to that\\npeaceful spot, she passed again, and the old church received her in its\\nquiet shade.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV. VANITY OF LIFE. (100)\\n\\nJohann Gottfried von Herder, 1744-1803, an eminent German poet, preacher,\\nand philosopher, was born in Mohrungen, and died in Weimar. His published\\nworks comprise sixty volumes. This selection is from his \"Hebrew Poetry.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nMan, born of woman,\\nIs of a few days,\\nAnd full of trouble;\\nHe cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down;\\nHe fleeth also as a shadow,\\nAnd continueth not.\\n\\nUpon such dost thou open thine eye,\\nAnd bring me unto judgment with thee?\\nAmong the impure is there none pure?\\nNot one.\\n\\nAre his days so determined?\\nHast thou numbered his months,\\nAnd set fast his bounds for him\\nWhich he can never pass?\\nTurn then from him that he may rest,\\nAnd enjoy, as an hireling, his day.\\n\\nThe tree hath hope, if it be cut down,\\nIt becometh green again,\\nAnd new shoots are put forth.\\nIf even the root is old in the earth,\\nAnd its stock die in the ground,\\nFrom vapor of water it will bud,\\nAnd bring forth boughs as a young plant.\\n\\nBut man dieth, and his power is gone;\\nHe is taken away, and where is he?\\n\\nTill the waters waste from the sea,\\nTill the river faileth and is dry land,\\nMan lieth low, and riseth not again.\\nTill the heavens are old, he shall not awake,\\nNor be aroused from his sleep.\\n\\nOh, that thou wouldest conceal me\\nIn the realm of departed souls!\\nHide me in secret, till thy wrath be past;\\nAppoint me then a new term,\\nAnd remember me again.\\nBut alas! if a man die\\nShall he live again?\\n\\nSo long, then, as my toil endureth,\\nWill I wait till a change come to me.\\nThou wilt call me, and I shall answer;\\nThou wilt pity the work of thy hands.\\nThough now thou numberest my steps,\\nThou shalt then not watch for my sin.\\nMy transgression will be sealed in a bag,\\nThou wilt bind up and remove my iniquity.\\n\\nYet alas! the mountain falleth and is swallowed up,\\nThe rock is removed out of its place,\\nThe waters hollow out the stones,\\nThe floods overflow the dust of the earth,\\nAnd thus, thou destroyest the hope of man.\\n\\nThou contendest with him, till he faileth,\\nThou changest his countenance, and sendeth him away.\\nThough his sons become great and happy,\\nYet he knoweth it not;\\nIf they come to shame and dishonor,\\nHe perceiveth it not.\\n\\n\\nNote.--Compare with the translation of the same as given in the ordinary\\nversion of the Bible. Job xiv.\\n\\n\\n\\nXV. A POLITICAL PAUSE. (102)\\n\\nCharles James Fox, 1749-1806, a famous English orator and statesman, was\\nthe son of Hon. Henry Fox, afterward Lord Holland; he was also a lineal\\ndescendant of Charles II. of England and of Henry IV, of France. He\\nreceived his education at Westminster, Eton, and Oxford, but left the\\nUniversity without graduating. He was first elected to Parliament before\\nhe was twenty years old. During the American Revolution, he favored the\\ncolonies; later, he was a friend and fellow-partisan both with Burke and\\nWilberforce. Burke said of him, \"He is the most brilliant and successful\\ndebater the world ever saw.\" In his later years, Mr. Fox was as remarkable\\nfor carelessness in dress and personal appearance, as he had been for the\\nopposite in his youth. He possessed many pleasing traits of character, but\\nhis morals were not commendable; he was a gambler and a spendthrift. Yet\\nhe exercised a powerful influence on the politics of his times. This\\nextract is from a speech delivered during a truce in the long war between\\nEngland and France.\\n###\\n\\n\\n\"But we must pause,\" says the honorable gentleman. What! must the bowels\\nof Great Britain be torn out, her best blood spilt, her treasures wasted,\\nthat you may make an experiment? Put yourselves--Oh! that you would put\\nyourselves on the field of battle, and learn to judge of the sort of\\nhorrors you excite. In former wars, a man might at least have some\\nfeeling, some interest, that served to balance in his mind the impressions\\nwhich a scene of carnage and death must inflict.\\n\\nBut if a man were present now at the field of slaughter, and were to\\ninquire for what they were fighting--\"Fighting!\", would be the answer;\\n\"they are not fighting; they are pausing.\" \"Why is that man expiring? Why\\nis that other writhing with agony? What means this implacable fury?\" The\\nanswer must be, \"You are quite wrong, sir, you deceive yourself,--they are\\nnot fighting,--do not disturb them,--they are merely pausing! This man is\\nnot expiring with agony,--that man is not dead,--he is only pausing! Bless\\nyou, sir, they are not angry with one another; they have now no cause of\\nquarrel; but their country thinks that there should be a pause. All that\\nyou see is nothing like fighting,--there is no harm, nor cruelty, nor\\nbloodshed in it; it is nothing more than a political pause. It is merely\\nto try an experiment--to see whether Bonaparte will not behave himself\\nbetter than heretofore; and, in the meantime, we have agreed to a pause,\\nin pure friendship!\"\\n\\nAnd is this the way that you are to show yourselves the advocates of\\norder? You take up a system calculated to uncivilize the world, to destroy\\norder, to trample on religion, to stifle in the heart not merely the\\ngenerosity of noble sentiment, but the affections of social nature; and in\\nthe prosecution of this system, you spread terror and devastation all\\naround you.\\n\\n\\nNote.--In this lesson, the influence of a negative in determining the\\nrising inflection, is noticeable. See Rule V, p. 24.\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI. MY EXPERIENCE IN ELOCUTION. (104)\\n\\nJohn Neal. 1793-1876, a brilliant but eccentric American writer, was born\\nin Portland, Maine. He went into business, when quite young, in company\\nwith John Pierpont, the well-known poet. They soon failed, and Mr. Neal\\nthen turned his attention to the study of law. He practiced his profession\\nsomewhat, but devoted most of his time to literature. For a time he\\nresided in England, where he wrote for \"Blackwood\\'s Magazine\" and other\\nperiodicals. His writings were produced with great rapidity, and with a\\npurposed disregard of what is known as \"classical English.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nIn the academy I attended, elocution was taught in a way I shall never\\nforget--never! We had a yearly exhibition, and the favorites of the\\npreceptor were allowed to speak a piece; and a pretty time they had of it.\\nSomehow I was never a favorite with any of my teachers after the first two\\nor three days; and, as I went barefooted, I dare say it was thought\\nunseemly, or perhaps cruel, to expose me upon the platform. And then, as I\\nhad no particular aptitude for public speaking, and no relish for what was\\ncalled oratory, it was never my luck to be called up.\\n\\nAmong my schoolmates, however, was one--a very amiable, shy boy--to whom\\nwas assigned, at the first exhibition I attended, that passage in Pope\\'s\\nHomer beginning with,\\n\\n  \"Aurora, now, fair daughter of the dawn!\"\\n\\nThis the poor boy gave with so much emphasis and discretion, that, to me,\\nit sounded like \"O roarer!\" and I was wicked enough, out of sheer envy, I\\ndare say, to call him \"O roarer!\"--a nickname which clung to him for a\\nlong while, though no human being ever deserved it less; for in speech and\\naction both, he was quiet, reserved, and sensitive.\\n\\nMy next experience in elocution was still more disheartening, so that I\\nnever had a chance of showing what I was capable of in that way till I set\\nup for myself. Master Moody, my next instructor, was thought to have\\nuncommon qualifications for teaching oratory. He was a large, handsome,\\nheavy man, over six feet high; and having understood that the first,\\nsecond, and third prerequisite in oratory was action, the boys he put in\\ntraining were encouraged to most vehement and obstreperous manifestations.\\nLet me give an example, and one that weighed heavily on my conscience for\\nmany years after the poor man passed away.\\n\\nAmong his pupils were two boys, brothers, who were thought highly gifted\\nin elocution. The master, who was evidently of that opinion, had a habit\\nof parading them on all occasions before visitors and strangers; though\\none bad lost his upper front teeth and lisped badly, and the other had the\\nvoice of a penny trumpet. Week after week these boys went through the\\nquarrel of Brutus and Cassius, for the benefit of myself and others, to\\nsee if their example would not provoke us to a generous competition for\\nall the honors.\\n\\nHow it operated on the other boys in after life I can not say; but the\\neffect on me was decidedly unwholesome--discouraging, indeed,--until I was\\nold enough to judge for myself, and to carry into operation a system of my\\nown.\\n\\nOn coming to the passage,--\\n\\n  \"Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;\\n   Dash him to pieces!\"--\\n\\nthe elder of the boys gave it after the following fashion: \"Be ready,\\ngodths, with all your thunderbolths,--dath him in pietheth!\"--bringing\\nhis right fist down into his left palm with all his strength, and his\\nlifted foot upon the platform, which was built like a sounding-board, so\\nthat the master himself, who had suggested the action and obliged the poor\\nboy to rehearse it over and over again, appeared to be utterly carried\\naway by the magnificent demonstration; while to me--so deficient was I in\\nrhetorical taste--it sounded like a crash of broken crockery, intermingled\\nwith chicken peeps.\\n\\nI never got over it; and to this day can not endure stamping, nor even\\ntapping of the foot, nor clapping the hands together, nor thumping the\\ntable for illustration; having an idea that such noises are not oratory,\\nand that untranslatable sounds are not language.\\n\\nMy next essay was of a somewhat different kind. I took the field in\\nperson, being in my nineteenth year, well proportioned, and already\\nbeginning to have a sincere relish for poetry, if not for declamation. I\\nhad always been a great reader; and in the course of my foraging\\ndepredations I had met with \"The Mariner\\'s Dream\" and \"The Lake of the\\nDismal Swamp,\" both of which I had committed to memory before I knew it.\\n\\nAnd one day, happening to be alone with my sister, and newly rigged out in\\na student\\'s gown, such as the lads at Brunswick sported when they came to\\nshow off among their old companions, I proposed to astonish her by\\nrehearsing these two poems in appropriate costume. Being very proud of her\\nbrother, and very obliging, she consented at once,--upon condition that\\nour dear mother, who had never seen anything of the sort, should be\\ninvited to make one of the audience.\\n\\nOn the whole, I rather think that I succeeded in astonishing both. I well\\nremember their looks of amazement--for they had never seen anything better\\nor worse in all their lives, and were no judges of acting--as I swept to\\nand fro in that magnificent robe, with outstretched arms and uplifted\\neyes, when I came to passages like the following, where an apostrophe was\\ncalled for:\\n\\n  \"And near him the she wolf stirred the brake,\\n    And the copper snake breathed in his ear,\\n  Till he, starting, cried, from his dream awake,\\n    \\'Oh, when shall I see the dusky lake,\\n    And the white canoe of my dear\\'!\\'\"\\n\\nOr like this:\\n\\n  \"On beds of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid;\\n  Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow,\\n  Of thy fair yellow locks, threads of amber be made,\\n  And every part suit to thy mansion below;\"--\\n\\nthrowing up my arms, and throwing them out in every possible direction as\\nthe spirit moved me, or the sentiment prompted; for I always encouraged my\\nlimbs and features to think for themselves, and to act for themselves, and\\nnever predetermined, never forethought, a gesture nor an intonation in my\\nlife; and should as soon think of counterfeiting another\\'s look or step or\\nvoice, or of modulating my own by a pitch pipe (as the ancient orators\\ndid, with whom oratory was acting elocution, a branch of the dramatic\\nart), as of adopting or imitating the gestures and tones of the most\\ncelebrated rhetorician I ever saw.\\n\\nThe result was rather encouraging. My mother and sister were both\\nsatisfied. At any rate, they said nothing to the contrary. Being only in\\nmy nineteenth year, what might I not be able to accomplish after a little\\nmore experience!\\n\\nHow little did I think, while rehearsing before my mother and sister, that\\nanything serious would ever come of it, or that I was laying the\\nfoundations of character for life, or that I was beginning what I should\\nnot be able to finish within the next forty or fifty years following. Yet\\nso it was. I had broken the ice without knowing it. These things were but\\nthe foreshadowing of what happened long afterward.\\n\\n\\nNotes.--Brunswick, Maine, is the seat of Bowdoin College.\\n\\n\"The Mariner\\'s Dream\" is a poem by \\'William Dimond.\\n\\n\"The Lake of the Dismal Swamp\" is by Thomas Moore.\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII. ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD. (108)\\n\\nThomas Gray, 1716-1771, is often spoken of as \"the author of the\\nElegy,\"--this simple yet highly finished and beautiful poem being by far\\nthe best known of an his writings. It was finished in 1749,--seven years\\nfrom the time it was commenced. Probably no short poem in the language\\never deserved or received more praise. Gray was born in London; his father\\npossessed property, but was indolent and selfish; his mother was a\\nsuccessful woman of business, and supported her son in college from her\\nown earnings. The poet was educated at Eton and Cambridge; at the latter\\nplace, he resided for several years after his return from a continental\\ntour, begun in 1739. He was small and delicate in person, refined and\\nprecise in dress and manners, and shy and retiring in disposition. He was\\nan accomplished scholar in many fields of learning, but left comparatively\\nlittle finished work in any department. He declined the honor of poet\\nlaureate; but, in 1769, was appointed Professor of History at Cambridge.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\\n  The lowing herd winds slowly o\\'er the lea,\\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\\n  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.\\n\\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\\n  And all the air a solemn stillness holds,\\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\\n  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\\n\\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,\\n  The moping owl does to the moon

(113)\\n\\nTalent is something, but tact is everything. Talent is serious, sober,\\ngrave, and respectable: tact is all that, and more too. It is not a sixth\\nsense, but it is the life of all the five. It is the open eye, the quick\\near, the judging taste, the keen smell, and the lively touch; it is the\\ninterpreter of all riddles, the surmounter of all difficulties, the\\nremover of all obstacles. It is useful in all places, and at all times; it\\nis useful in solitude, for it shows a man into the world; it is useful in\\nsociety, for it shows him his way through the world.\\n\\nTalent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is momentum; talent\\nknows what to do, tact knows how to do it; talent makes a man respectable,\\ntact will make him respected; talent is wealth, tact is ready money. For\\nall the practical purposes, tact carries it against talent ten to one.\\n\\nTake them to the theater, and put them against each other on the stage,\\nand talent shall produce you a tragedy that shall scarcely live long\\nenough to be condemned, while tact keeps the house in a roar, night after\\nnight, with its successful farces. There is no want of dramatic talent,\\nthere is no want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together: so we\\nhave successful pieces which are not respectable, and respectable pieces\\nwhich are not successful.\\n\\nTake them to the bar, and let them shake their learned curls at each other\\nin legal rivalry; talent sees its way clearly, but tact is first at its\\njourney\\'s end. Talent has many a compliment from the bench, but tact\\ntouches fees. Talent makes the world wonder that it gets on no faster,\\ntact arouses astonishment that it gets on so fast. And the secret is, that\\nit has no weight to carry; it makes no false steps; it hits the right nail\\non the head; it loses no time; it takes all hints; and, by keeping its eye\\non the weathercock, is ready to take advantage of every wind that blows.\\n\\nTake them into the church: talent has always something worth hearing, tact\\nis sure of abundance of hearers; talent may obtain a living, tact will\\nmake one; talent gets a good name, tact a great one; talent convinces,\\ntact converts; talent is an honor to the profession, tact gains honor from\\nthe profession.\\n\\nTake them to court: talent feels its weight, tact finds its way; talent\\ncommands, tact is obeyed; talent is honored with approbation, and tact is\\nblessed by preferment. Place them in the senate: talent has the ear of the\\nhouse, but tact wins its heart, and has its votes; talent is fit for\\nemployment, but tact is fitted for it. It has a knack of slipping into\\nplace with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as a billiard ball\\ninsinuates itself into the pocket.\\n\\nIt seems to know everything, without learning anything. It has served an\\nextemporary apprenticeship; it wants no drilling; it never ranks in the\\nawkward squad; it has no left hand, no deaf ear, no blind side. It puts on\\nno look of wondrous wisdom, it has no air of profundity, but plays with\\nthe details of place as dexterously as a well-taught hand flourishes over\\nthe keys of the pianoforte. It has all the air of commonplace, and all the\\nforce and power of genius.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX. SPEECH BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION. (115)\\n\\nPatrick Henry, 1730-1799, was born in Hanover County, Virginia, He\\nreceived instruction in Latin and mathematics from his father, but seemed\\nto develop a greater fondness for hunting, fishing, and playing the fiddle\\nthan for study. Twice he was set up in business, and twice failed before\\nhe was twenty-four. He was then admitted to the bar after six weeks\\' study\\nof the law. He got no business at first in his profession, but lived with\\nhis father-in-law. His wonderful powers of oratory first showed themselves\\nin a celebrated case which he argued in Hanover Courthouse, his own father\\nbeing the presiding magistrate. He began very awkwardly, but soon rose to\\na surprising height of eloquence, won his case against great odds, and was\\ncarried off in triumph by the delighted spectators. His fame was now\\nestablished; business flowed in, and he was soon elected to the Virginia\\nLegislature. He was a delegate to the Congress of 1774, and in 1775 made\\nthe prophetic speech of which the following selection is a portion.  It\\nwas his own motion that the \"colony be immediately put in a state of\\ndefense.\" During the Revolution he was, for several years, Governor of\\nVirginia. In 1788 he earnestly opposed the adoption of the Federal\\nConstitution. When he died, he left a large family and an ample fortune.\\nIn person, Mr. Henry was tall and rather awkward, with a face stern and\\ngrave. When he spoke on great occasions, his awkwardness forsook him, his\\nface lighted up, and his eyes flashed with a wonderful fire. In his life,\\nhe was good-humored, honest, and temperate. His patriotism was of the\\nnoblest type; and few men in those stormy times did better service for\\ntheir country than he.\\n###\\n\\n\\nIt is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to\\nshut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that\\nsiren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men,\\nengaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be\\nof the number of those, who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear\\nnot the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my\\npart, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the\\nwhole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\\n\\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of\\nexperience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past;\\nand, judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the\\nconduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those\\nhopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the\\nhouse? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately\\nreceived? Trust it not: it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not\\nyourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves, how this gracious\\nreception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which\\ncover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a\\nwork of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to\\nbe reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us\\nnot deceive ourselves. These are the implements of war and subjugation,--\\nthe last arguments to which kings resort.\\n\\nI ask, gentlemen, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to\\nforce us into submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive\\nfor it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call\\nfor all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, she has none. They are\\nmeant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind\\nand rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so\\nlong forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?\\nWe have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to\\noffer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every\\nlight in which it was capable; but it has been all in vain.\\n\\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we\\nfind which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you,\\ndeceive ourselves longer. We have done everything that could be done, to\\navert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have\\nremonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves at the\\nfoot of the throne, and implored its interposition to arrest the\\ntyrannical bands of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been\\nslighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult;\\nour supplications disregarded; and we have been spurned with contempt from\\nthe foot of the throne.\\n\\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\\nreconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be\\nfree; if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for\\nwhich we have been so long contending; if we mean not basely to abandon\\nthe noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we\\nhave pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our\\ncontest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, we must fight! An\\nappeal to arms and the God of Hosts, is all that is left us.\\n\\nThey tell us that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an\\nadversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the\\nnext year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\\nguard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by\\nirresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual\\nresistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive\\nphantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? We\\nare not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the God of\\nnature hath placed in our power.\\n\\nThree millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such\\na country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our\\nenemy can send against us. Besides, we shall not fight our battles alone.\\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who\\nwill raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle is not to\\nthe strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides,\\nwe have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too\\nlate to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and\\nslavery! Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains\\nof Boston! The war is inevitable; and; let it come! I repeat it, let it\\ncome!\\n\\nIt is in vain to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace, peace; but\\nthere is no peace. The war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps\\nfrom the north, will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our\\nbrethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that\\ngentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,\\nas to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty\\nGod! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me\\nliberty, or give me death.\\n\\n\\nNotes.--Observe, in this lesson, the all-controlling power of emphasis in\\ndetermining the falling inflection. The words \"see,\" \"hear,\" and \"my,\" in\\nthe first paragraph, the word \"that\" in the second, and \"spurned\" and\\n\"contempt\" in the fourth paragraph, are examples of this. Let the reader\\nremember that a high degree of emphasis is sometimes expressed by a\\nwhisper; also, that emphasis is often expressed by a pause.\\n\\nIt will be well to read in this connection some good history of the\\nopening scenes of the Revolution.\\n\\n\\n\\nXX: THE AMERICAN FLAG. (119)\\n\\nJoseph Rodman Drake. 1795-1820, was born in New York City. His father died\\nwhen he was very young, and his early life was a struggle with poverty. He\\nstudied medicine, and took his degree when he was about twenty years old.\\nFrom a child, he showed remarkable poetical powers, having made rhymes at\\nthe early age of five. Most of his published writings were produced during\\na period of less than two years. \"The Culprit Fay\" and the \"American Flag\"\\nare best known. In disposition, Mr. Drake was gentle and kindly; and, on\\nthe occasion of his death, his intimate friend, Fitz-Greene Halleck,\\nexpressed his character in the well-known couplet:\\n\\n   \"None knew thee but to love thee,\\n   Nor named thee but to praise.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nWhen Freedom, from her mountain height,\\n  Unfurled her standard to the air,\\nShe tore the azure robe of night,\\n  And set the stars of glory there:\\nShe mingled with its gorgeous dyes\\nThe milky baldric of the skies,\\nAnd striped its pure, celestial white\\nWith streakings of the morning light;\\nThen, from his mansion in the sun,\\nShe called her eagle bearer down,\\nAnd gave into his mighty hand\\nThe symbol of her chosen land.\\n\\nMajestic monarch of the cloud!\\n  Who rear\\'st aloft thy regal form,\\nTo hear the tempest trumpings loud,\\nAnd see the lightning lances driven,\\n  When strive the warriors of the storm,\\nAnd rolls the thunder drum of heaven;--\\nChild of the sun! to thee \\'t is given\\n  To guard the banner of the free,\\nTo hover in the sulphur smoke,\\nTo ward away the battle stroke,\\nAnd bid its blendings shine afar,\\nLike rainbows on the cloud of war,\\n   The harbingers of victory!\\n\\nFlag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,\\nThe sign of hope and triumph high!\\nWhen speaks the signal trumpet tone,\\nAnd the long line comes gleaming on,\\nEre yet the lifeblood, warm and wet,\\nHas dimmed the glistening bayonet,\\nEach soldier\\'s eye shall brightly turn\\nTo where thy sky-born glories burn,\\nAnd, as his springing steps advance,\\nCatch war and vengeance from the glance.\\nAnd when the cannon mouthings loud\\nHeave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,\\nAnd gory sabers rise and fall,\\nLike shoots of flame on midnight\\'s pall,\\nThen shall thy meteor glances glow,\\nAnd cowering foes shall sink beneath\\nEach gallant arm, that strikes below\\nThat lovely messenger of death.\\n\\nFlag of the seas! on ocean\\'s wave\\nThy stars shall glitter o\\'er the brave;\\nWhen death careering on the gale,\\nSweeps darkly round the bellied sail,\\nAnd frighted waves rush wildly back,\\nBefore the broadside\\'s reeling rack,\\nEach dying wanderer of the sea\\nShall look at once to heaven and thee,\\nAnd smile to see thy splendors fly\\nIn triumph o\\'er his closing eye.\\n\\nFlag of the free heart\\'s hope and home,\\n  By angel hands to valor given,\\nThy stars have lit the welkin dome,\\n  And all thy hues were born in heaven.\\nForever float that standard sheet!\\n  Where breathes the foe but falls before us,\\nWith Freedom\\'s soil beneath our feet,\\n  And Freedom\\'s banner streaming o\\'er us?\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI. IRONICAL EULOGY ON DEBT. (121)\\n\\n\\nDebt is of the very highest antiquity. The first debt in the history of\\nman is the debt of nature, and the first instinct is to put off the\\npayment of it to the last moment. Many persons, it will be observed,\\nfollowing the natural procedure, would die before they would pay their\\ndebts.\\n\\nSociety is composed of two classes, debtors and creditors. The creditor\\nclass has been erroneously supposed the more enviable. Never was there a\\ngreater misconception; and the hold it yet maintains upon opinion is a\\nremarkable example of the obstinacy of error, notwithstanding the plainest\\nlessons of experience. The debtor has the sympathies of mankind. He is\\nseldom spoken of but with expressions of tenderness and compassion--\"the\\npoor debtor!\"--and \"the unfortunate debtor!\" On the other hand, \"harsh\"\\nand \"hard-hearted\" are the epithets allotted to the creditor. Who ever\\nheard the \"poor creditor,\" the \"unfortunate creditor\" spoken of? No, the\\ncreditor never becomes the object of pity, unless he passes into the\\ndebtor class. A creditor may be ruined by the poor debtor, but it is not\\nuntil he becomes unable to pay his own debts, that he begins to be\\ncompassionated.\\n\\nA debtor is a man of mark. Many eyes are fixed upon him; many have\\ninterest in his well-being; his movements are of concern; he can not\\ndisappear unheeded; his name is in many mouths; his name is upon many\\nbooks; he is a man of note--of promissory note; he fills the speculation\\nof many minds; men conjecture about him, wonder about him,--wonder and\\nconjecture whether he will pay. He is a man of consequence, for many are\\nrunning after him. His door is thronged with duns. He is inquired after\\nevery hour of the day. Judges hear of him and know him. Every meal he\\nswallows, every coat he puts upon his back, every dollar he borrows,\\nappears before the country in some formal document. Compare his notoriety\\nwith the obscure lot of the creditor,--of the man who has nothing but\\nclaims on the world; a landlord, or fundholder, or some such disagreeable,\\nhard character.\\n\\nThe man who pays his way is unknown in his neighborhood. You ask the\\nmilkman at his door, and he can not tell his name. You ask the butcher\\nwhere Mr. Payall lives, and he tells you he knows no such name, for it is\\nnot in his books. You shall ask the baker, and he will tell you there is\\nno such person in the neighborhood. People that have his money fast in\\ntheir pockets, have no thought of his person or appellation. His house\\nonly is known. No. 31 is good pay. No. 31 is ready money. Not a scrap of\\npaper is ever made out for No. 31. It is an anonymous house; its owner\\npays his way to obscurity. No one knows anything about him, or heeds his\\nmovements. If a carriage be seen at his door, the neighborhood is not full\\nof concern lest he be going to run away. If a package be removed from his\\nhouse, a score of boys are not employed to watch whether it be carried to\\nthe pawnbroker. Mr. Payall fills no place in the public mind; no one has\\nany hopes or fears about him.\\n\\nThe creditor always figures in the fancy as a sour, single man, with\\ngrizzled hair, a scowling countenance, and a peremptory air, who lives in\\na dark apartment, with musty deeds about him, and an iron safe, as\\nimpenetrable as his heart, grabbing together what he does not enjoy, and\\nwhat there is no one about him to enjoy. The debtor, on the other hand, is\\nalways pictured with a wife and six fair-haired daughters, bound together\\nin affection and misery, full of sensibility, and suffering without a\\nfault. The creditor, it is never doubted, thrives without a merit. He has\\nno wife and children to pity. No one ever thinks it desirable that he\\nshould have the means of living. He is a brute for insisting that he must\\nreceive, in order to pay. It is not in the imagination of man to conceive\\nthat his creditor has demands upon him which must be satisfied, and that\\nhe must do to others as others must do to him. A creditor is a\\npersonification of exaction. He is supposed to be always taking in, and\\nnever giving out.\\n\\nPeople idly fancy that the possession of riches is desirable. What\\nblindness! Spend and regale. Save a shilling and you lay it by for a\\nthief. The prudent men are the men that live beyond their means. Happen\\nwhat may, they are safe. They have taken time by the forelock. They have\\nanticipated fortune. \"The wealthy fool, with gold in store,\" has only\\ndenied himself so much enjoyment, which another will seize at his expense.\\nLook at these people in a panic. See who are the fools then. You know them\\nby their long faces. You may say, as one of them goes by in an agony of\\napprehension, \"There is a stupid fellow who fancied himself rich, because\\nhe had fifty thousand dollars in bank.\" The history of the last ten years\\nhas taught the moral, \"spend and regale.\" Whatever is laid up beyond the\\npresent hour, is put in jeopardy. There is no certainty but in instant\\nenjoyment. Look at schoolboys sharing a plum cake. The knowing ones eat,\\nas for a race; but a stupid fellow saves his portion; just nibbles a bit,\\nand \"keeps the rest for another time.\" Most provident blockhead! The\\nothers, when they have gobbled up their shares, set upon him, plunder him,\\nand thrash him for crying out.\\n\\nBefore the terms \"depreciation,\" \"suspension,\" and \"going into\\nliquidation,\" were heard, there might have been some reason in the\\npractice of \"laying up;\" but now it denotes the darkest blindness. The\\nprudent men of the present time, are the men in debt. The tendency being\\nto sacrifice creditors to debtors, and the debtor party acquiring daily\\nnew strength, everyone is in haste to get into the favored class. In any\\ncase, the debtor is safe. He has put his enjoyments behind him; they are\\nsafe; no turns of fortune can disturb them. The substance he has eaten up,\\nis irrecoverable. The future can not trouble his past. He has nothing to\\napprehend. He has anticipated more than fortune would ever have granted\\nhim. He has tricked fortune; and his creditors--bah! who feels for\\ncreditors? What are creditors? Landlords; a pitiless and unpitiable tribe;\\nall griping extortioners! What would become of the world of debtors, if it\\ndid not steal a march upon this rapacious class?\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII. THE THREE WARNINGS. (124)\\n\\nHester Lynch Thrale. 1739--1821, owes her celebrity almost wholly to her\\nlong intimacy with Dr. Samuel Johnson. This continued for twenty years,\\nduring which Johnson spent much time in her family. She was born in\\nCaernarvonshire, Wales; her first husband was a wealthy brewer, by whom\\nshe had several children. In 1784, she married an Italian teacher of music\\nnamed Piozzi. Her writings are quite numerous; the best known of her books\\nis the \"Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson;\" but nothing she ever wrote is so well\\nknown as the \"Three Warnings.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe tree of deepest root is found\\nLeast willing still to quit the ground;\\n\\'T was therefore said by ancient sages,\\n  That love of life increased with years\\nSo much, that in our latter stages,\\nWhen pains grow sharp, and sickness rages,\\n  The greatest love of life appears.\\n\\nThis great affection to believe,\\nWhich all confess, but few perceive,\\nIf old assertions can\\'t prevail,\\nBe pleased to hear a modern tale.\\n\\nWhen sports went round, and all were gay,\\nOn neighbor Dodson\\'s wedding day,\\nDeath called aside the jocund groom\\nWith him into another room;\\nAnd looking grave, \"You must,\" says he,\\n\"Quit your sweet bride, and come with me.\"\\n\"With you! and quit my Susan\\'s side?\\nWith you!\" the hapless bridegroom cried:\\n\"Young as I am, \\'t is monstrous hard!\\nBesides, in truth, I\\'m not prepared.\"\\n\\nWhat more he urged, I have not heard;\\n  His reasons could not well be stronger:\\nSo Death the poor delinquent spared,\\n  And left to live a little longer.\\nYet, calling up a serious look,\\nHis hourglass trembled while he spoke:\\n\"Neighbor,\" he said, \"farewell! no more\\nShall Death disturb your mirthful hour;\\nAnd further, to avoid all blame\\nOf cruelty upon my name,\\nTo give you time for preparation,\\nAnd fit you for your future station,\\nThree several warnings you shall have\\nBefore you\\'re summoned to the grave;\\nWilling for once I\\'ll quit my prey,\\n  And grant a kind reprieve;\\nIn hopes you\\'ll have no more to say,\\nBut, when I call again this way,\\n  Well pleased the world will leave.\"\\nTo these conditions both consented,\\nAnd parted perfectly contented.\\n\\nWhat next the hero of our tale befell,\\nHow long he lived, how wisely, and how well,\\nIt boots not that the Muse should tell;\\nHe plowed, he sowed, he bought, he sold,\\nNor once perceived his growing old,\\n  Nor thought of Death as near;\\nHis friends not false, his wife no shrew,\\nMany his gains, his children few,\\nHe passed his hours in peace.\\nBut, while he viewed his wealth increase,\\nWhile thus along life\\'s dusty road,\\nThe beaten track, content he trod,\\nOld Time, whose haste no mortal spares,\\nUncalled, unheeded, unawares,\\n  Brought on his eightieth year.\\n\\nAnd now, one night, in musing mood,\\n  As all alone he sate,\\n  The unwelcome messenger of Fate\\nOnce more before him stood.\\nHalf-killed with wonder and surprise,\\n\"So soon returned!\" old Dodson cries.\\n\"So soon d\\' ye call it?\" Death replies:\\n\"Surely! my friend, you\\'re but in jest;\\n  Since I was here before,\\n\\'T is six and thirty years at least,\\n  And you are now fourscore.\"\\n\"So much the worse!\" the clown rejoined;\\n\"To spare the aged would be kind:\\nBesides, you promised me three warnings,\\nWhich I have looked for nights and mornings!\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" cries Death, \"that at the best,\\nI seldom am a welcome guest;\\nBut do n\\'t be captious, friend; at least,\\nI little thought that you\\'d be able\\nTo stump about your farm and stable;\\nYour years have run to a great length,\\nYet still you seem to have your strength.\"\\n\\n\"Hold!\" says the farmer, \"not so fast!\\nI have been lame, these four years past.\"\\n\"And no great wonder,\" Death replies,\\n\"However, you still keep your eyes;\\nAnd surely, sir, to see one\\'s friends,\\nFor legs and arms would make amends.\"\\n\"Perhaps,\" says Dodson, \"so it might,\\nBut latterly I\\'ve lost my sight.\"\\n\"This is a shocking story, faith;\\nBut there\\'s some comfort still,\" says Death;\\n\"Each strives your sadness to amuse;\\nI warrant you hear all the news.\"\\n\"There\\'s none,\" cries he, \"and if there were,\\nI\\'ve grown so deaf, I could not hear.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, then,\" the specter stern rejoined,\\n  \"These are unpardonable yearnings;\\nIf you are lame, and deaf, and blind,\\n  You\\'ve had your three sufficient warnings,\\nSo, come along; no more we\\'ll part.\"\\nHe said, and touched him with his dart:\\nAnd now old Dodson, turning pale,\\nYields to his fate--so ends my tale.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII. THE MEMORY OF OUR FATHERS. (128)\\n\\nLyman Beecher, 1775-1863, a famous congregational minister of New England,\\nwas born in New Haven, graduated from Yale College in 1797, and studied\\ntheology with Dr. Timothy Dwight. His first settlement was at East\\nHampton, L. I., at a salary of three hundred dollars per year. He was\\npastor of the church in Litchfield, Ct., from 1810 till 1826, when he\\nremoved to Boston, and took charge of the Hanover Street Church. In the\\nreligious controversies of the time, Dr. Beecher was one of the most\\nprominent characters. From 1832 to 1842, he was President of Lane\\nTheological Seminary, in the suburbs of Cincinnati. He then returned to\\nBoston, where he spent most of the closing years of his long and active\\nlife. His death occurred in Brooklyn, N. Y. As a theologian, preacher, and\\nadvocate of education, temperance, and missions, Dr. Beecher occupied a\\nvery prominent place for nearly half a century. He left a large family of\\nsons and two daughters, who are well known as among the most eminent\\npreachers and authors in America.\\n###\\n\\n\\nWe are called upon to cherish with high veneration and grateful\\nrecollections, the memory of our fathers. Both the ties of nature and the\\ndictates of policy demand this. And surely no nation had ever less\\noccasion to be ashamed of its ancestry, or more occasion for gratulation\\nin that respect; for while most nations trace their origin to barbarians,\\nthe foundations of our nation were laid by civilized men, by Christians.\\nMany of them were men of distinguished families, of powerful talents, of\\ngreat learning and of preeminent wisdom, of decision of character, and of\\nmost inflexible integrity. And yet not unfrequently they have been treated\\nas if they had no virtues; while their sins and follies have been\\nsedulously immortalized in satirical anecdote.\\n\\nThe influence of such treatment of our fathers is too manifest. It creates\\nand lets loose upon their institutions, the vandal spirit of innovation\\nand overthrow; for after the memory of our father shall have been rendered\\ncontemptible, who will appreciate and sustain their institutions? \"The\\nmemory of our fathers\" should be the watchword of liberty throughout the\\nland; for, imperfect as they were, the world before had not seen their\\nlike, nor will it soon, we fear, behold their like again. Such models of\\nmoral excellence, such apostles of civil and religious liberty, such\\nshades of the illustrious dead looking down upon their descendants with\\napprobation or reproof, according as they follow or depart from the good\\nway, constitute a censorship inferior only to the eye of God; and to\\nridicule them is national suicide.\\n\\nThe doctrines of our fathers have been represented as gloomy,\\nsuperstitious, severe, irrational, and of a licentious tendency. But when\\nother systems shall have produced a piety as devoted, a morality as pure,\\na patriotism as disinterested, and a state of society as happy, as have\\nprevailed where their doctrines have been most prevalent, it may be in\\nseason to seek an answer to this objection.\\n\\nThe persecutions instituted by our fathers have been the occasion of\\nceaseless obloquy upon their fair fame. And truly, it was a fault of no\\nordinary magnitude, that sometimes they did persecute. But let him whose\\nancestors were not ten times more guilty, cast the first stone, and the\\nashes of our fathers will no more be disturbed. Theirs was the fault of\\nthe age, and it will be easy to show that no class of men had, at that\\ntime, approximated so nearly to just apprehensions of religious liberty;\\nand that it is to them that the world is now indebted for the more just\\nand definite views which now prevail.\\n\\nThe superstition and bigotry of our fathers are themes on which some of\\ntheir descendants, themselves far enough from superstition, if not from\\nbigotry, have delighted to dwell. But when we look abroad, and behold the\\ncondition of the world, compared with the condition of New England, we may\\njustly exclaim, \"Would to God that the ancestors of all the nations had\\nbeen not only almost, but altogether such bigots as our fathers were.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV. SHORT SELECTIONS IN PROSE. (130)\\n\\nI. DRYDEN AND POPE.\\n\\nDryden knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in his local\\nmanners. The notions of Dryden were formed by comprehensive speculation,\\nthose of Pope by minute attention. There is more dignity in the knowledge\\nof Dryden, more certainty in that of Pope. The style of Dryden is\\ncapricious and varied, that of Pope cautious and uniform. Dryden obeys the\\nmotions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to his own rules of\\ncomposition. Dryden\\'s page is a natural field, rising into inequalities,\\nand diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation; Pope\\'s is\\nthe velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe, and leveled by the roller. If the\\nflights of Dryden are higher, Pope continues longer on the wing. If, of\\nDryden\\'s fire, the blaze is brighter, of Pope\\'s the heat is more regular\\nand constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation, and Pope never falls\\nbelow it. Dryden is read with frequent astonishment, and Pope with\\nperpetual delight.\\n                                                --Samuel Johnson.\\n\\nNote.--A fine example of antithesis. See p. 26.\\n\\n\\n\\nII. LAS CASAS DISSUADING FROM BATTLE. (130)\\n\\nIs then the dreadful measure of your cruelty not yet complete? Battle!\\nagainst whom? Against a king, in whose mild bosom your atrocious injuries,\\neven yet, have not excited hate; but who, insulted or victorious, still\\nsues for peace. Against a people, who never wronged the living being their\\nCreator formed; a people, who received you as cherished guests, with eager\\nhospitality and confiding kindness. Generously and freely did they share\\nwith you their comforts, their treasures, and their homes; you repaid them\\nby fraud, oppression, and dishonor.\\n\\nPizarro, hear me! Hear me, chieftains! And thou, All-powerful! whose\\nthunder can shiver into sand the adamantine rock, whose lightnings can\\npierce the core of the riven and quaking earth, oh let thy power give\\neffect to thy servant\\'s words, as thy Spirit gives courage to his will! Do\\nnot, I implore you, chieftains,--do not, I implore, you, renew the foul\\nbarbarities your insatiate avarice has inflicted on this wretched,\\nunoffending race. But hush, my sighs! fall not, ye drops of useless\\nsorrow! heart-breaking anguish, choke not my utterance.\\n                                                     --E. B. Sheridan.\\n\\nNote.--Examples of series. See p. 28.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. ACTION AND REPOSE. (131)\\n\\nJohn Ruskin, 1819 ---, is a distinguished English art critic and author.\\nFrom 1869 to 1884, he was Professor of the Fine Arts at Oxford University.\\nHis writings are very numerous, and are noted for their eloquent and\\nbrilliant style.\\n###\\n\\n\\nAbout the river of human life there is a wintry wind, though a heavenly\\nsunshine; the iris colors its agitation, the frost fixes upon its repose.\\nLet us beware that our rest become not the rest of stones, which, so long\\nas they are tempest-tossed and thunderstricken, maintain their majesty;\\nbut when the stream is silent and the storm passed, suffer the grass to\\ncover them, and are plowed into the dust.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. TIME AND CHANGE. (131)\\n\\nSir Humphry Davy, 1778-1829, was an eminent chemist of England. He made\\nmany important chemical discoveries, and was the inventor of the miner\\'s\\nsafety lamp.\\n###\\n\\n\\nTime is almost a human word, and Change entirely a human idea; in the\\nsystem of nature, we should rather say progress than change. The sun\\nappears to sink in the ocean in darkness, but it rises in another\\nhemisphere; the ruins of a city fall, but they are often used to form more\\nmagnificent structures: even when they are destroyed so as to produce only\\ndust, Nature asserts her empire over them; and the vegetable world rises\\nin constant youth, in a period of annual successions, by the labors of\\nman--providing food, vitality, and beauty--upon the wrecks of monuments\\nwhich were raised for the purposes of glory, but which are now applied to\\nobjects of utility.\\n\\n\\n\\nV. THE POET. (132)\\n\\nWilliam Ellery Channing, 1780-1842, was a distinguished clergyman and\\norator. He took a leading part in the public affairs of his day, and wrote\\nand lectured eloquently on several topics.\\n###\\n\\n\\nIt is not true that the poet paints a life which does not exist. He only\\nextracts and concentrates, as it were, life\\'s ethereal essence, arrests\\nand condenses its volatile fragrance, brings together its scattered\\nbeauties, and prolongs its more refined but evanescent joys; and in this\\nhe does well, for it is good to feel that life is not wholly usurped by\\ncares for subsistence and physical gratifications, but admits, in measures\\nwhich may be indefinitely enlarged, sentiments and delights worthy of a\\nhigher being.\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. MOUNTAINS. (132)\\n\\nWilliam Howitt, 1795-1879, was an English author. He published many books,\\nand was associated with his wife, Mary Howitt, in the publication of many\\nothers.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThere is a charm connected with mountains, so powerful that the merest\\nmention of them, the merest sketch of their magnificent features, kindles\\nthe imagination, and carries the spirit at once into the bosom of their\\nenchanted regions. How the mind is filled with their vast solitude! How\\nthe inward eye is fixed on their silent, their sublime, their everlasting\\npeaks! How our hearts bound to the music of their solitary cries, to the\\ntinkle of their gushing rills, to the sound of their cataracts! How\\ninspiriting are the odors that breathe from the upland turf, from the\\nrock-hung flower, from the hoary and solemn pine! How beautiful are those\\nlights and shadows thrown abroad, and that fine, transparent haze which is\\ndiffused over the valleys and lower slopes, as over a vast, inimitable\\npicture!\\n\\n\\n\\nXXV. THE JOLLY OLD PEDAGOGUE. (133)\\n\\nGeorge Arnold, 1834--1865, was born in New York City. He never attended\\nschool, but was educated at home, by his parents. His literary career\\noccupied a period of about twelve years. In this time he wrote stories,\\nessays, criticisms in art and literature, poems, sketches, etc., for\\nseveral periodicals. Two volumes of his poems have been published since\\nhis death.\\n###\\n\\n\\n\\'T was a jolly old pedagogue, long ago,\\n  Tall, and slender, and sallow, and dry;\\nHis form was bent, and his gait was slow,\\nAnd his long, thin hair was white as snow,\\n  But a wonderful twinkle shone in his eye:\\nAnd he sang every night as he went to bed,\\n  \"Let us be happy down here below;\\nThe living should live, though the dead be dead,\"\\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nHe taught the scholars the Rule of Three,\\n  Reading, and writing, and history too;\\nHe took the little ones on his knee,\\nFor a kind old heart in his breast had he,\\n  And the wants of the littlest child he knew.\\n\"Learn while you\\'re young,\" he often said,\\n  \"There is much to enjoy down here below;\\nLife for the living, and rest for the dead!\"\\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nWith the stupidest boys, he was kind and cool,\\n  Speaking only in gentlest tones;\\nThe rod was scarcely known in his school--\\nWhipping to him was a barbarous rule,\\n  And too hard work for his poor old bones;\\nBesides it was painful, he sometimes said:\\n  \"We should make life pleasant down here below--\\nThe living need charity more than the dead,\"\\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nHe lived in the house by the hawthorn lane,\\n  With roses and woodbine over the door;\\nHis rooms were quiet, and neat, and plain,\\nBut a spirit of comfort there held reign,\\n  And made him forget he was old and poor.\\n\"I need so little,\" he often said;\\n  \"And my friends and relatives here below\\nWon\\'t litigate over me when I am dead,\"\\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nBut the pleasantest times he had of all,\\n  Were the sociable hours he used to pass,\\nWith his chair tipped back to a neighbor\\'s wall,\\nMaking an unceremonious call,\\n  Over a pipe and a friendly glass:\\nThis was the finest pleasure, he said,\\n  Of the many he tasted here below:\\n\"Who has no cronies had better be dead,\"\\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nThe jolly old pedagogue\\'s wrinkled face\\n  Melted all over in sunshiny smiles;\\nHe stirred his glass with an old-school grace,\\nChuckled, and sipped, and prattled apace,\\n  Till the house grew merry from cellar to tiles.\\n\"I\\'m a pretty old man,\" he gently said,\\n  \"I\\'ve lingered a long time here below;\\nBut my heart is fresh, if my youth is fled!\"\\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nHe smoked his pipe in the balmy air\\n  Every night, when the sun went down;\\nAnd the soft wind played in his silvery hair,\\nLeaving its tenderest kisses there,\\n  On the jolly old pedagogue\\'s jolly old crown;\\nAnd feeling the kisses, he smiled, and said:\\n  \" \\'T is it glorious world down here below;\\nWhy wait for happiness till we are dead?\"\\n  Said this jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\\n\\nHe sat at his door one midsummer night,\\n  After the sun had sunk in the west,\\nAnd the lingering beams of golden light\\nMade his kindly old face look warm and bright,\\n  While the odorous night winds whispered, \"Rest!\"\\nGently, gently, he bowed his head;\\n  There were angels waiting for him, I know;\\nHe was sure of his happiness, living or dead,\\n  This jolly old pedagogue, long ago!\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI. THE TEACHER AND SICK SCHOLAR. (135)\\n\\nShortly after the schoolmaster had arranged the forms and taken his seat\\nbehind his desk, a small white-headed boy with a sunburnt face appeared at\\nthe door, and, stopping there to make a rustic bow, came in and took his\\nseat upon one of the forms. He then put an open book, astonishingly\\ndog\\'s-eared, upon his knees, and, thrusting his hands into his pockets,\\nbegan counting the marbles with which they were filled; displaying, in the\\nexpression of his face, a remarkable capacity of totally abstracting his\\nmind from the spelling on which his eyes were fixed.\\n\\nSoon afterward, another white-headed little boy came straggling in, and\\nafter him, a red-headed lad, and then one with a flaxen poll, until the\\nforms were occupied by a dozen boys, or thereabouts, with heads of every\\ncolor but gray, and ranging in their ages from four years old to fourteen\\nyears or more; for the legs of the youngest were a long way from the\\nfloor, when he sat upon the form; and the eldest was a heavy,\\ngood-tempered fellow, about half a head taller than the schoolmaster.\\n\\nAt the top of the first form--the post of honor in the school--was the\\nvacant place of the little sick scholar; and, at the head of the row of\\npegs, on which those who wore hats or caps were wont to hang them, one was\\nempty. No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat or peg, but many a\\none looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster, and whispered to his\\nidle neighbor, behind his hand.\\n\\nThen began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart, the\\nwhispered jest and stealthy game, and all the noise and drawl of school;\\nand in the midst of the din, sat the poor schoolmaster, vainly attempting\\nto fix his mind upon the duties of the day, and to forget his little sick\\nfriend. But the tedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the\\nwilling scholar, and his thoughts were rambling from his pupils--it was\\nplain.\\n\\nNone knew this better than the idlest boys, who, growing bolder with\\nimpunity, waxed louder and more daring; playing \"odd or even\" under the\\nmaster\\'s eye; eating apples openly and without rebuke; pinching each other\\nin sport or malice, without the least reserve; and cutting their initials\\nin the very legs of his desk. The puzzled dunce, who stood beside it to\\nsay his lesson \"off the book,\" looked no longer at the ceiling for\\nforgotten words, but drew closer to the master\\'s elbow, and boldly cast\\nhis eye upon the page; the wag of the little troop squinted and made\\ngrimaces (at the smallest boy, of course), holding no book before his\\nface, and his approving companions knew no constraint in their delight. If\\nthe master did chance to rouse himself, and seem alive to what was going\\non, the noise subsided for a moment, and no eye met his but wore a\\nstudious and deeply humble look; but the instant he relapsed again, it\\nbroke out afresh, and ten times louder than before.\\n\\nOh! how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and how they\\nlooked at the open door and window, as if they half meditated rushing\\nviolently out, plunging into the woods, and being wild boys and savages\\nfrom that time forth. What rebellious thoughts of the cool river, and some\\nshady bathing place, beneath willow trees with branches dipping in the\\nwater, kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy, who, with his shirt\\ncollar unbuttoned, and flung back as far as it could go, sat fanning his\\nflushed face with a spelling book, wishing himself a whale, or a minnow,\\nor a fly, or anything but a boy at school, on that hot, broiling day.\\n\\nHeat! ask that other boy, whose seat being nearest to the door, gave him\\nopportunities of gliding out into the garden, and driving his companions\\nto madness, by dipping his face into the bucket of the well, and then\\nrolling on the grass,--ask him if there was ever such a day as that, when\\neven the bees were diving deep down into the cups of the flowers, and\\nstopping there, as if they had made up their minds to retire from\\nbusiness, and be manufacturers of honey no more. The day was made for\\nlaziness, and lying on one\\'s back in green places, and staring at the sky,\\ntill its brightness forced the gazer to shut his eyes and go to sleep. And\\nwas this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark room, slighted by\\nthe very sun itself? Monstrous!\\n\\nThe lessons over, writing time began. This was a more quiet time; for the\\nmaster would come and look over the writer\\'s shoulder, and mildly tell him\\nto observe how such a letter was turned up, in such a copy on the wall,\\nwhich had been written by their sick companion, and bid him take it as a\\nmodel. Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had said last\\nnight, and how he had longed to be among them once again; and such was the\\npoor schoolmaster\\'s gentle and affectionate manner, that the boys seemed\\nquite remorseful that they had worried him so much, and were absolutely\\nquiet; eating no apples, cutting no names, and making no grimaces for full\\ntwo minutes afterward.\\n\\n\"I think, boys,\" said the schoolmaster, when the clock struck twelve,\\n\"that I shall give you an extra half holiday this afternoon.\" At this\\nintelligence, the boys, led on and headed by the tall boy, raised a great\\nshout, in the midst of which the master was seen to speak, but could not\\nbe heard. As he held up his hand, however, in token of his wish that they\\nshould be silent, they were considerate enough to leave off, as soon as the\\nlongest-winded among them were quite out of breath. \"You must promise\\nme, first,\" said the schoolmaster, \"that you\\'ll not be noisy, or at least,\\nif you are, that you\\'ll go away first, out of the village, I mean. I\\'m\\nsure you would n\\'t disturb your old playmate and companion.\"\\n\\nThere was a general murmur (and perhaps a very sincere one, for they were\\nbut boys) in the negative; and the tall boy, perhaps as sincerely as any\\nof them, called those about him to witness, that he had only shouted in a\\nwhisper. \"Then pray do n\\'t forget, there\\'s my dear scholars,\" said the\\nschoolmaster, \"what I have asked you, and do it as a favor to me. Be as\\nhappy as you can, and do n\\'t be unmindful that you are blessed with\\nhealth. Good-by, all.\"\\n\\n\"Thank \\'ee, sir,\" and \"Good-by, sir,\" were said a great many times in a\\ngreat variety of voices, and the boys went out very slowly and softly. But\\nthere was the sun shining and there were birds singing, as the sun only\\nshines and the birds only sing on holidays and half holidays; there were\\nthe trees waving to all free boys to climb, and nestle among their leafy\\nbranches; the hay, entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air;\\nthe green corn, gently beckoning toward wood and stream; the smooth\\nground, rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows, inviting\\nto runs and leaps, and long walks, nobody knows whither. It was more than\\nboy could bear, and with a joyous whoop, the whole cluster took to their\\nheels, and spread themselves about, shouting and laughing as they went.\\n\" \\'T is natural, thank Heaven!\" said the poor schoolmaster, looking after\\nthem, \"I am very glad they did n\\'t mind me.\"\\n\\nToward night, the schoolmaster walked over to the cottage where his little\\nfriend lay sick. Knocking gently at the cottage door, it was opened\\nwithout loss of time. He entered a room where a group of women were\\ngathered about one who was wringing her hands and crying bitterly. \"O\\ndame!\" said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, \"is it so bad as\\nthis?\" Without replying, she pointed to another room, which the\\nschoolmaster immediately entered; and there lay his little friend,\\nhalf-dressed, stretched upon a bed.\\n\\nHe was a very young boy; quite a little child. His hair still hung in\\ncurls about his face, and his eyes were very bright; but their light was\\nof heaven, not of earth. The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and,\\nstooping over the pillow whispered his name. The boy sprung up, stroked\\nhis face with his hand, and threw his wasted arms around his neck, crying,\\nthat he was his dear, kind friend. \"I hope I always was. I meant to be,\\nGod knows,\" said the poor schoolmaster. \"You remember my garden, Henry?\"\\nwhispered the old man, anxious to rouse him, for dullness seemed gathering\\nupon the child, \"and how pleasant it used to be in the evening time? You\\nmust make haste to visit it again, for I think the very flowers have\\nmissed you, and are less gay than they used to be. You will come soon,\\nvery soon now, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\nThe boy smiled faintly--so very, very faintly--and put his hand upon his\\nfriend\\'s gray head. He moved his lips too, but no voice came from them,--\\nno, not a sound. In the silence that ensued, the hum of distant voices,\\nborne upon the evening air, came floating through the open window. \"What\\'s\\nthat?\" said the sick child, opening his eyes. \"The boys at play, upon the\\ngreen.\" He took a handkerchief from his pillow, and tried to wave it above\\nhis head. But the feeble arm dropped powerless down. \"Shall I do it?\" said\\nthe schoolmaster. \"Please wave it at the window,\" was the faint reply.\\n\"Tie it to the lattice. Some of them may see it there. Perhaps they\\'ll\\nthink of me, and look this way.\"\\n\\nHe raised his head and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle bat,\\nthat lay, with slate, and book, and other boyish property, upon the table\\nin the room. And then he laid him softly down once more, and again clasped\\nhis little arms around the old man\\'s neck. The two old friends and\\ncompanions--for such they were, though they were man and child--held each\\nother in a long embrace, and then the little scholar turned his face to\\nthe wall and fell asleep.\\n\\n* * * * * * * * *\\n\\nThe poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding the small, cold hand\\nin his, and chafing it. It was but the hand of a dead child. He felt that;\\nand yet he chafed it still, and could not lay it down.\\n\\n                                 From \"The Old Curiosity Shop,\" by Dickens.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII. THE SNOW SHOWER. (141)\\n\\nWilliam Cullen Bryant, 1794-1878, was the son of Peter Bryant, a physician\\nof Cummington, Massachusetts. Amid the beautiful scenery of this remote\\ncountry town, the poet was born; and here he passed his early youth. At\\nthe age of sixteen, Bryant entered Williams College, but was honorably\\ndismissed at the end of two years. He then entered on the study of law,\\nand was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-one. He practiced his\\nprofession, with much success, for about nine years. In 1826, he removed\\nto New York, and became connected with the \"Evening Post,\" a connection\\nwhich continued to the time of his death. For more than thirty of the last\\nyears of his life, Mr. Bryant made his home near Roslyn, Long Island,\\nwhere he occupied an \"old-time mansion,\" which he bought, fitted up, and\\nsurrounded in accordance with his excellent rural taste. A poem of his,\\nwritten at the age of ten years, was published in the \"County Gazette,\"\\nand two poems of considerable length were published in book form, when the\\nauthor was only fourteen. \"Thanatopsis,\" perhaps the best known of all his\\npoems, was written when he was but nineteen. But, notwithstanding his\\nprecocity, his powers continued to a remarkable age. His, excellent\\ntranslations of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey,\" together with some of his\\nbest poems, were accomplished after the poet, had passed the age of\\nseventy. Mr. Bryant visited Europe several times; and, in 1849, he\\ncontinued his travels into Egypt and Syria. Abroad, he was received with\\nmany marks of distinction; and he added much to his extensive knowledge by\\nstudying the literature of the countries he visited.\\n\\nAll his poems exhibit a peculiar love, and a careful study, of nature; and\\nhis language, both in prose and poetry, is always chaste, elegant, and\\ncorrect. His mind was well-balanced; and his personal character was one to\\nbe admired, loved, and imitated.\\n###\\n\\n\\nStand here by my side and turn, I pray,\\n  On the lake below thy gentle eyes;\\nThe clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,\\n  And dark and silent the water lies;\\nAnd out of that frozen mist the snow\\nIn wavering flakes begins to flow;\\n                    Flake after flake\\nThey sink in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\nSee how in a living swarm they come\\n From the chambers beyond that misty veil;\\nSome hover in air awhile, and some\\n Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.\\nAll, dropping swiftly, or settling slow,\\nMeet, and are still in the depths below;\\n                    Flake after flake\\nDissolved in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\nHere delicate snow stars, out of the cloud,\\n  Come floating downward in airy play,\\nLike spangles dropped from the glistening crowd\\n  That whiten by night the Milky Way;\\nThere broader and burlier masses fall;\\nThe sullen water buries them all,--\\n                      Flake after flake,--\\nAll drowned in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\nAnd some, as on tender wings they glide\\n  From their chilly birth cloud, dim and gray.\\nAre joined in their fall, and, side by side,\\n  Come clinging along their unsteady way;\\nAs friend with friend, or husband with wife,\\nMakes hand in hand the passage of life;\\n                       Each mated flake\\nSoon sinks in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\nLo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste\\n  Stream down the snows, till the air is white,\\nAs, myriads by myriads madly chased,\\n  They fling themselves from their shadowy height.\\nThe fair, frail creatures of middle sky,\\nWhat speed they make, with their grave so nigh;\\n                 Flake after flake\\nTo lie in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\nI see in thy gentle eyes a tear;\\n  They turn to me in sorrowful thought;\\nThou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,\\n  Who were for a time, and now are not;\\nLike these fair children of cloud and frost,\\nThat glisten a moment an then are lost,\\n                   Flake after flake,--\\nAll lost in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\nYet look again, for the clouds divide;\\n  A gleam of blue on the water lies;\\nAnd far away, on the mountain side,\\n  A sunbeam falls from the opening skies.\\nBut the hurrying host that flew between\\nThe cloud and the water no more is seen;\\n                  Flake after flake\\nAt rest in the dark and silent lake.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII. CHARACTER OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. (143)\\n\\nCharles Phillips, 1787-1859, an eminent barrister and orator, was born in\\nSligo, Ireland, and died in London. He gained much of his reputation as an\\nadvocate in criminal cases. In his youth he published some verses; later\\nin life he became the author of several works, chiefly of biography.\\n###\\n\\n\\nHe is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid prodigy, which towered\\namong us like some ancient ruin, whose power terrified the glance its\\nmagnificence attracted. Grand, gloomy, and peculiar, he sat upon the\\nthrone a sceptered hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own originality. A\\nmind, bold, independent, and decisive; a will, despotic in its dictates;\\nan energy that distanced expedition; and a conscience, pliable to every\\ntouch of interest, marked the outlines of this extraordinary\\ncharacter--the most extraordinary, perhaps, that in the annals of this\\nworld ever rose, or reigned, or fell.\\n\\nFlung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every energy\\nof a people who acknowledged no superior, he commenced his course, a\\nstranger by birth, and a scholar by charity. With no friend but his sword,\\nand no fortune but his talents, he rushed into the lists where rank, and\\nwealth, and genius had arrayed themselves, and competition fled from him,\\nas from the glance of destiny.\\n\\nHe knew no motive but interest; acknowledged no criterion but success; he\\nworshiped no God but ambition; and, with an eastern devotion, he knelt at\\nthe shrine of his idolatry. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he\\ndid not profess, there was no opinion that he did not promulgate: in the\\nhope of a dynasty, he upheld the crescent; for the sake of a divorce, he\\nbowed before the cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he became the adopted\\nchild of the Republic; and, with a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins\\nboth of the throne and the tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism.\\nA professed Catholic, he imprisoned the Pope; a pretended patriot, he\\nimpoverished the country; and in the name of Brutus, he grasped without\\nremorse, and wore without shame, the diadem of the Caesars.\\n\\nThe whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his designs, and\\nthe miracle of their execution. Skepticism bowed to the prodigies of his\\nperformance; romance assumed the air of history; nor was there aught too\\nincredible for belief, or too fanciful for expectation, when the world saw\\na subaltern of Corsica waving his imperial flag over her most ancient\\ncapitals. All the visions of antiquity became commonplace in his\\ncontemplation: kings were his people; nations were his outposts; and he\\ndisposed of courts, and crowns, and camps, and churches, and cabinets, as\\nif they were the titular dignitaries of the chessboard! Amid all these\\nchanges, he stood immutable as adamant. It mattered little whether in the\\nfield, or in the drawing-room; with the mob, or the levee; wearing the\\nJacobin bonnet, or the iron crown; banishing a Braganza, or espousing a\\nHapsburg; dictating peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia, or\\ncontemplating defeat at the gallows of Leipsic he was still the same\\nmilitary despot.\\n\\nIn this wonderful combination, his affectations of literature must not be\\nomitted. The jailer of the press, he affected the patronage of letters;\\nthe proscriber of books, he encouraged philosophy; the persecutor of\\nauthors, and the murderer of printers, he yet pretended to the protection\\nof learning; the assassin of Palm, the silencer of De Stael, and the\\ndenouncer of Kotzebue, he was the friend of David, the benefactor of De\\nLille, and sent his academic prize to the philosopher of England.\\n\\nSuch a medley of contradictions, and, at the same time, such an individual\\nconsistency, were never united in the same character. A royalist, a\\nrepublican, and an emperor; a Mohammedan, a Catholic, and a patron of the\\nsynagogue; a subaltern and a sovereign; a traitor and a tyrant; a\\nChristian and an infidel; he was, through all his vicissitudes, the same\\nstern, impatient, inflexible original; the same mysterious,\\nincomprehensible self; the man without a model, and without a shadow.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--St. Louis (b. 1215, d. 1270), a wise and pious king of France,\\nknown as Louis IX.

(146)\\n\\nJohn Pierpont, 1785-1866, was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, and\\ngraduated from Yale College in 1804. The next four years he spent as a\\nprivate tutor in the family of Col. William Allston, of South Carolina. On\\nhis return, he studied law in the law school of his native town. He\\nentered upon practice, but soon left the law for mercantile pursuits, in\\nwhich he was unsuccessful. Having studied theology at Cambridge, in 1819\\nhe was ordained pastor of the Hollis Street Unitarian Church, in Boston,\\nwhere he continued nearly twenty years. He afterwards preached four years\\nfor a church in Troy, New York, and then removed to Medford,\\nMassachusetts. At the age of seventy-six, he became chaplain of a\\nMassachusetts regiment; but, on account of infirmity, war soon obliged to\\ngive up the position. Mr. Pierpont published a series of school readers,\\nwhich enjoyed a well-deserved popularity for many years.\\n\\nHis poetry is smooth, musical, and vigorous. Most of his pieces were\\nwritten for special occasions.\\n###\\n\\n\\nHis falchion flashed along the Nile;\\n  His hosts he led through Alpine snows;\\nO\\'er Moscow\\'s towers, that blazed the while,\\n  His eagle flag unrolled,--and froze.\\nHere sleeps he now, alone! Not one\\n  Of all the kings, whose crowns he gave,\\nBends o\\'er his dust;--nor wife nor son\\n  Has ever seen or sought his grave.\\n\\nBehind this seagirt rock! the star,\\n  That led him on from crown to crown,\\nHas sunk; and nations from afar\\n  Gazed as it faded and went down.\\nHigh is his couch;--the ocean flood,\\n  Far, far below, by storms is curled;\\nAs round him heaved, while high he stood,\\n  A stormy and unstable world.\\n\\nAlone he sleeps! The mountain cloud,\\n  That night hangs round him, and the breath\\nOf morning scatters, is the shroud\\n  That wraps the conqueror\\'s clay in death.\\nPause here! The far-off world, at last,\\n  Breathes free; the hand that shook its thrones,\\nAnd to the earth its miters cast,\\n  Lies powerless now beneath these stones.\\n\\nHark! comes there from the pyramids,\\n  And from Siberian wastes of snow,\\nAnd Europe\\'s hills, a voice that bids\\n  The world he awed to mourn him? No:\\nThe only, the perpetual dirge\\n  That\\'s heard there is the sea bird\\'s cry,--\\nThe mournful murmur of the surge,--\\n  The cloud\\'s deep voice, the wind\\'s low sigh.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--Seagirt rock, the island of St. Helena, is in the Atlantic Ocean,\\nnearly midway between Africa and South America. Napoleon was confined on\\nthis island six years; until 1821, when he died and was buried there. In\\n1841, his remains were removed to Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXX. WAR. (148)\\n\\nCharles Sumner. 1811-1874, was born in Boston. He studied at the Latin\\nschool in his native city, graduated from Harvard University at the age of\\nnineteen, studied law at the same institution, and was admitted to\\npractice in 1834. He at once took a prominent position in his profession,\\nlectured to the law classes at Cambridge for several successive years,\\nwrote and edited several standard law books, and might have had a\\nprofessorship in the law school, had he desired it. In his famous address\\non \"The True Grandeur of Nations,\" delivered July 4, 1815, before the\\nmunicipal authorities of Boston, he took strong grounds against war among\\nnations. In 1851 he was elected to the United States Senate and continued\\nin that position till his death. As a jurist, as a statesman, as an\\norator, and as a profound and scholarly writer, Mr. Sumner stands high in\\nthe estimation of his countrymen. In physical appearance, Mr. Sumner was\\ngrand and imposing; men often turned to gaze after him, as he passed along\\nthe streets of his native city.\\n###\\n\\n\\nI need not dwell now on the waste and cruelty of war. These stare us\\nwildly in the face, like lurid meteor lights, as we travel the page of\\nhistory. We see the desolation and death that pursue its demoniac\\nfootsteps. We look upon sacked towns, upon ravaged territories, upon\\nviolated homes; we behold all the sweet charities of life changed to\\nwormwood and gall. Our soul is penetrated by the sharp moan of mothers,\\nsisters, and daughters--of fathers, brothers, and sons, who, in the\\nbitterness of their bereavement, refuse to be comforted. Our eyes rest at\\nlast upon one of these fair fields, where Nature, in her abundance,\\nspreads her cloth of gold, spacious and apt for the entertainment of\\nmighty multitudes--or perhaps, from the curious subtlety of its position,\\nlike the carpet in the Arabian tale, seeming to contract so as to be\\ncovered by a few only, or to dilate so as to receive an innumerable host.\\nHere, under a bright sun, such as shone at Austerlitz or Buena\\nVista--amidst the peaceful harmonies of nature--on the Sabbath of\\npeace--we behold bands of brothers, children of a common Father, heirs to\\na common happiness, struggling together in the deadly fight, with the\\nmadness of fallen spirits, seeking with murderous weapons the lives of\\nbrothers who have never injured them or their kindred. The havoc rages.\\nThe ground is soaked with their commingling blood. The air is rent by\\ntheir commingling cries. Horse and rider are stretched together on the\\nearth. More revolting than the mangled victims, than the gashed limbs,\\nthan the lifeless trunks, than the spattering brains, are the lawless\\npassions which sweep, tempest-like, through the fiendish tumult.\\n\\nHorror-struck, we ask, wherefore this hateful contest? The melancholy, but\\ntruthful answer comes, that this is the established method of determining\\njustice between nations!\\n\\nThe scene changes. Far away on the distant pathway of the ocean two ships\\napproach each other, with white canvas broadly spread to receive the\\nflying gales. They are proudly built. All of human art has been lavished\\nin their graceful proportions, and in their well compacted sides, while\\nthey look in their dimensions like floating happy islands on the sea. A\\nnumerous crew, with costly appliances of comfort, hives in their secure\\nshelter. Surely these two travelers shall meet in joy and friendship; the\\nflag at the masthead shall give the signal of friendship; the happy\\nsailors shall cluster in the rigging, and even on the yardarms, to look\\neach other in the face, while the exhilarating voices of both crews shall\\nmingle in accents of gladness uncontrollable. It is not so. Not as\\nbrothers, not as friends, not as wayfarers of the common ocean, do they\\ncome together; but as enemies.\\n\\nThe gentle vessels now bristle fiercely with death-dealing instruments. On\\ntheir spacious decks, aloft on all their masts, flashes the deadly\\nmusketry. From their sides spout cataracts of flame, amidst the pealing\\nthunders of a fatal artillery. They, who had escaped \"the dreadful touch\\nof merchant-marring rocks\"--who had sped on their long and solitary way\\nunharmed by wind or wave--whom the hurricane had spared--in whose favor\\nstorms and seas had intermitted their immitigable war--now at last fall\\nby the hand of each other. The same spectacle of horror greets us from\\nboth ships. On their decks, reddened with blood, the murderers of St.\\nBartholomew and of the Sicilian Vespers, with the fires of Smithfield,\\nseem to break forth anew, and to concentrate their rage. Each has now\\nbecome a swimming Golgotha. At length, these vessels--such pageants of\\nthe sea--once so stately--so proudly built--but now rudely shattered by\\ncannon balls--with shivered mast\\'s and ragged sails--exist only as\\nunmanageable wrecks, weltering on the uncertain waves, whose temporary\\nlull of peace is now their only safety. In amazement at this strange,\\nunnatural contest--away from country and home--where there is no country\\nor home to defend--we ask again, wherefore this dismal duel? Again the\\nmelancholy but truthful answer promptly comes, that this is the\\nestablished method of determining justice between nations.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Austerlitz, a small town in Austria, seventy miles north from\\nVienna. It is noted as the site of a battle, in December, 1805, between\\nthe allied Austrian and Russian armies, and the French under Napoleon. The\\nlatter were victorious.

SPEECH OF WALPOLE IN REPROOF OF MR. PITT. (151)\\n\\nSir Robert Walpole, 1676-1745, was educated at Eton and Cambridge. He\\nentered Parliament in 1700, and soon became a good debater and skillful\\ntactician. He was prime minister of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742, in\\nthe reigns of George I. and George II. He was an able statesman; but has\\nbeen accused of employing corruption or bribery on a large scale, to\\ncontrol Parliament and accomplish his purposes.\\n###\\n\\n\\nI was unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate, while it was\\ncarried on with calmness and decency, by men who do not suffer the ardor\\nof opposition to cloud their reason, or transport them to such expressions\\nas the dignity of this assembly does not admit.\\n\\nI have hitherto deferred answering the gentleman, who declaimed against\\nthe bill with such fluency and rhetoric, and such vehemence of gesture;\\nwho charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed, with having no\\nregard to any interests but their own, and with making laws only to\\nconsume paper, and threatened them with the defection of their adherents,\\nand the loss of their influence, upon this new discovery of their folly\\nand ignorance. Nor, do I now answer him for any other purpose than to\\nremind him how little the clamor of rage and petulancy of invective\\ncontribute to the end for which this assembly is called together; how\\nlittle the discovery of truth is promoted, and the security of the nation\\nestablished, by pompous diction and theatrical emotion.\\n\\nFormidable sounds and furious declamation, confident assertions and lofty\\nperiods, may affect the young and inexperienced; and perhaps the gentleman\\nmay have contracted his habits of oratory by conversing more with those of\\nhis own age than with such as have more opportunities of acquiring\\nknowledge, and more successful methods of communicating their sentiments.\\nIf the heat of temper would permit him to attend to those whose age and\\nlong acquaintance with business give them an indisputable right to\\ndeference and superiority, he would learn in time to reason, rather than\\ndeclaim; and to prefer justness of argument and an accurate knowledge of\\nfacts, to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives, which may disturb\\nthe imagination for a moment, but leave no lasting impression upon the\\nmind. He would learn, that to accuse and prove are very different; and\\nthat reproaches, unsupported by evidence, affect only the character of him\\nthat utters them.\\n\\nExcursions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young\\nmen, but in no other; and it would surely contribute more, even to the\\npurpose for which some gentlemen appear to speak (that of depreciating the\\nconduct of the administration), to prove the inconveniences and injustice\\nof this bill, than barely to assert them, with whatever magnificence of\\nlanguage, or appearance of zeal, honesty, or compassion.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXII. PITT\\'S REPLY TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. (152)\\n\\nWilliam Pitt, 1708--1778, one of the ablest statesmen and orators of his\\ntime, was born in Cornwall, and educated at Eton and Oxford. He entered\\nParliament in 1735, and became a formidable opponent of the ministry of\\nSir Robert Walpole. He gained great reputation by his wise and vigorous\\nmanagement of military affairs in the last years of the reign of George\\nII. He opposed the \"Stamp Act\" with great earnestness, as well as the\\ncourse of the ministry in the early years of the American Revolution. In\\n1778, he rose from a sick bed to make his celebrated speech, in the House\\nof Lords, in opposition to a motion to acknowledge the independence of\\nAmerica. At its close, he fell in an apoplectic fit, and was borne home to\\ndie in a few weeks afterward. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Pitt\\npossessed a fine personal presence and a powerful voice; he was very\\npopular with the people, and is often called the \"Great Commoner.\" He was\\ncreated \"Earl of Chatham\" in 1766.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honorable gentleman\\nhas, with such spirit and decency, charged upon me, I shall neither\\nattempt to palliate nor deny; but content myself with hoping that I may be\\none of those whose follies cease with their youth, and not of that number\\nwho are ignorant in spite of experience. Whether youth can be imputed to a\\nman as a reproach, I will not assume the province of determining; but\\nsurely age may become justly contemptible, if the opportunities which it\\nbrings have passed away without improvement, and vice appears to prevail\\nwhen the passions have subsided. The wretch, who, after having seen the\\nconsequences of a thousand errors, continues still to blunder, and whose\\nage has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object either of\\nabhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that his gray hairs should secure\\nhim from insult. Much more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced\\nin age, has receded from virtue, and become more wicked--with less\\ntemptation; who prostitutes himself for money which he can not enjoy, and\\nspends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country.\\n\\nBut youth is not my only crime; I am accused of acting a theatrical part.\\nA theatrical part may either imply some peculiarity of gesture, or a\\ndissimulation of my real sentiments, and an adoption of the opinions and\\nlanguage of another man. In the first sense, the charge is too trifling to\\nbe confuted, and deserves only to be mentioned that it may be despised. I\\nam at liberty, like every other man, to use my own language; and though,\\nperhaps, I may have some ambition to please this gentleman, I shall not\\nlay myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his diction or\\nhis mien, however matured by age, or modeled by experience.\\n\\nBut, if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical behavior, imply that\\nI utter any sentiments but my own, I shall treat him as a calumniator and\\na villain; nor shall any protection shelter him from the treatment he\\ndeserves. I shall, on such an occasion, without scruple, trample upon all\\nthose forms with which wealth and dignity intrench themselves, nor shall\\nanything but age restrain my resentment; age,--which always brings one\\nprivilege, that of being insolent and supercilious, without punishment!\\n\\nBut, with regard to those whom I have offended, I am of opinion that, if I\\nhad acted a borrowed part, I should have avoided their censure: the heat\\nthat offended them was the ardor of conviction, and that zeal for the\\nservice of my country which neither hope nor fear shall influence me to\\nsuppress. I will not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, nor look\\nin silence upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavors, at whatever\\nhazard, to repel the aggressor, and drag the thief to justice, whoever may\\nprotect him in his villainies, and whoever may partake of his plunder.\\n\\n\\nXXXIII. CHARACTER OF MR. PITT. (154)\\n\\nHenry Grattan, 1750-1820, an Irish orator and statesman, was born at\\nDublin, and graduated from Trinity College, in his native city. By his\\nadmiration of Mr. Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, he was led to turn his\\nattention to oratory. In personal appearance, he was unprepossessing; but\\nhis private character was without a blemish.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy had not reached him. Original\\nand unaccommodating, the features of his character had the hardihood of\\nantiquity. His august mind overawed majesty itself. No state chicanery, no\\nnarrow system of vicious politics, no idle contest for ministerial\\nvictories, sank him to the vulgar level of the great; but overbearing,\\npersuasive, and impracticable, his object was England, his ambition was\\nfame.\\n\\nWithout dividing, he destroyed party; without corrupting, he made a venal\\nage unanimous. France sunk beneath him. With one hand he smote the house\\nof Bourbon, and wielded in the other the democracy of England. The sight\\nof his mind was infinite; and his schemes were to effect, not England, not\\nthe present age only, but Europe and posterity. Wonderful were the means\\nby which those schemes were accomplished; always seasonable, always\\nadequate, the suggestion of an understanding animated by ardor and\\nenlightened by prophecy.\\n\\nThe ordinary feelings which make life amiable and indolent, were unknown\\nto him. No domestic difficulties, no domestic weakness, reached him; but,\\naloof from the sordid occurrences of life, and unsullied by its\\nintercourse, he came occasionally into our system, to counsel and decide.\\nA character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so authoritative,\\nastonished a corrupt age, and the treasury trembled at the name of Pitt,\\nthrough all classes of venality. Corruption imagined, indeed, that she had\\nfound defects in this statesman, and talked much of the inconsistency of\\nhis glory, and much of the ruin of his victories; but the history of his\\ncountry, and the calamities of the enemy, answered and refuted her.\\n\\nNor were his political his only talents. His eloquence was an era in the\\nsenate; peculiar and spontaneous; familiarly expressing gigantic\\nsentiments and instructive wisdom; not like the torrent of Demosthenes, or\\nthe splendid conflagration of Tully; it resembled sometimes the thunder,\\nand sometimes the music of the spheres. He did not conduct the\\nunderstanding through the painful subtilty of argumentation, nor was he\\never on the rack of exertion; but rather lightened upon the subject, and\\nreached the point by the flashings of the mind, which, like those of the\\neye, were felt, but could not be followed.\\n\\nUpon the whole, there was in this man something that could create,\\nsubvert, or reform; an understanding, a spirit, and an eloquence, to\\nsummon mankind to society, or to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and\\nto rule the wildness of free minds with unbounded authority; something\\nthat could establish or overwhelm empires, and strike a blow in the world\\nthat should resound through the universe.\\n\\nNOTES.--Demosthenes (b. 385, d. 322, B. C.) was the son of a cutler at\\nAthens, Greece. By diligent study and unremitting toil, he became the\\ngreatest orator that ever lived.\\n\\nTully, Marcus Tullius Cicero (b. 106, d. 43, B. C.), was the most\\nremarkable of Roman orators. He held the highest office of the Republic.\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIV. THE SOLDIER\\'S REST. (156)\\n\\nSir Walter Scott, 1771-1832, the great Scotch poet and novelist, was born\\nin Edinburgh. Being a feeble child, he was sent to reside on his\\ngrandfather\\'s estate in the south of Scotland. Here he spent several\\nyears, and gained much knowledge of the traditions of border warfare, as\\nwell as of the tales and ballads pertaining to it. He was also a great\\nreader of romances in his youth. In 1779 be returned to Edinburgh, and\\nbecame a pupil in the high school. Four years later, he entered the\\nuniversity; but in neither school nor college, was he distinguished for\\nscholarship. In 1797 he was admitted to the practice of law,--a profession\\nwhich he soon forsook for literature. His first poems appeared in 1802.\\nThe \"Lay of the Last Minstrel\" was published in 1805, \"Marmion\" in 1808,\\nand \"The Lady of the Lake\" in 1810. Several poems of less power followed.\\nIn 1814 \"Waverley,\" his first novel, made its appearance, but the author\\nwas unknown for some time. Numerous other novels followed with great\\nrapidity, the author reaping a rich harvest both in fame and money. In\\n1811 he purchased an estate near the Tweed, to which he gave the name of\\nAbbotsford. In enlarging his estate and building a costly house, he spent\\nvast sums of money. This, together with the failure of his publishers in\\n1826, involved him very heavily in debt. But he set to work with almost\\nsuperhuman effort to pay his debts by the labors of his pen. In about four\\nyears, he had paid more than $300,000; but the effort was too much for his\\nstrength, and hastened his death.\\n\\nIn person, Scott was tall, and apparently robust, except a slight lameness\\nwith which he was affected from childhood. He was kindly in disposition,\\nhospitable in manner, fond of outdoor pursuits and of animals, especially\\ndogs. He wrote with astonishing rapidity, and always in the early morning.\\nAt his death, he left two sons and two daughters. A magnificent monument\\nto his memory has been erected in the city of his birth.

By many\\n(perhaps most) critics, Shakespeare is regarded as the greatest poet the\\nworld has ever produced; one calls him, \"The most illustrious of the sons\\nof men.\" And yet it is a curious fact that less is really known of his\\nlife and personal characteristics than is known of almost any other famous\\nname in history. Over one hundred years ago, a writer said, \"All that is\\nknown with any degree of certainty concerning Shakespeare is--that he was\\nborn at Stratford-upon-Avon--married and had children there--went to\\nLondon, where he commenced acting, and wrote poems and plays--returned to\\nStratford, made his will, died, and was buried.\" All the research of the\\nlast one hundred years has added but very little to this meager record. He\\nwas married, very young, to Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior;\\nwas joint proprietor of Blackfriar\\'s Theater in 1589, and seems to have\\naccumulated property, and retired three or four years before his death. He\\nwas buried in Stratford Church, where a monument has been erected to his\\nmemory; he also has a monument, in \"Poet\\'s Corner\" of Westminster Abbey.\\nHis family soon became extinct. From all we can learn, he seems to have\\nbeen highly respected and esteemed by his cotemporaries.\\n\\nHis works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. His writings show an\\nastonishing knowledge of human nature, expressed in language wonderful for\\nits point and beauty. His style is chaste and pure, judged by the standard\\nof his times, although expressions may sometimes be found that would not\\nbe considered proper in a modern writer. It has been argued by some that\\nShakespeare did not write the works imputed to him; but this theory seems\\nto have little to support it. This extract is from King Henry V., Act III,\\nScene I.\\n###\\n\\n\\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;\\nOr close the wall up with our English dead.\\nIn peace there \\'s nothing so becomes a man\\nAs modest stillness and humility:\\nBut when the blast of war blows in our ears,\\nThen imitate the action of the tiger;\\nStiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\\nDisguise fair nature with hard-favored rage;\\nThen lend the eye a terrible aspect;\\nLet it pry through the portage of the head\\nLike the brass cannon; let the brow o\\'erwhelm it\\nAs fearfully as doth a galled rock\\nO\\'er hang and jutty his confounded base,\\nSwilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.\\n\\nNow set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide,\\nHold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit\\nTo its full height!

Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of\\nGod, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver,\\nor stone, graven by art and man\\'s device. And the times of this ignorance\\nGod winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent: because he\\nhath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in\\nrighteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given\\nassurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. And when\\nthey heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said,\\nWe will hear thee again of this matter.

LAFAYETTE AND ROBERT RAIKES. (163)\\n\\nThomas S. Grimke\\', 1786-1834, an eminent lawyer and scholar, was born in\\nCharleston, South Carolina, graduated at Yale in 1807, and died of cholera\\nnear Columbus, Ohio. He descended from a Huguenot family that was exiled\\nfrom France by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He gained\\nconsiderable reputation as a politician, but is best known as an advocate\\nof peace, Sunday Schools, and the Bible. He was a man of deep feeling,\\nearnest purpose, and pure life. Some of his views were very radical and\\nvery peculiar. He proposed sweeping reforms in English orthography[1], and\\ndisapproved of the classics and of pure mathematics in any scheme of\\ngeneral education. The following is an extract from an address delivered\\nat a Sunday-school celebration.\\n###\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Footnote 1:  Orthography: Spelling using established\\nusage.]\\n\\n\\nIt is but a few years since we beheld the most singular and memorable\\npageant in the annals of time. It was a pageant more sublime and affecting\\nthan the progress of Elizabeth through England after the defeat of the\\nArmada; than the return of Francis I. from a Spanish prison to his own\\nbeautiful France; than the daring and rapid march of the conqueror at\\nAusterlitz from Frejus to Paris. It was a pageant, indeed, rivaled only in\\nthe elements of the grand and the pathetic, by the journey of our own\\nWashington through the different states. Need I say that I allude to the\\nvisit of Lafayette to America?\\n\\nBut Lafayette returned to the land of the dead, rather than of the living.\\nHow many who had fought with him in the war of \\'76, had died in arms, and\\nlay buried in the grave of the soldier or the sailor! How many who had\\nsurvived the perils of battle, on the land and the ocean, had expired on\\nthe deathbed of peace, in the arms of mother, sister, daughter, wife!\\nThose. who survived to celebrate with him the jubilee of 1825, were\\nstricken in years, and hoary-headed; many of them infirm in health; many\\nthe victims of poverty, or misfortune, or affliction. And, how venerable\\nthat patriotic company; how sublime their gathering through all the land;\\nhow joyful their welcome, how affecting their farewell to that beloved\\nstranger!\\n\\nBut the pageant has fled, and the very materials that gave it such depths\\nof interest are rapidly perishing: and a humble, perhaps a nameless grave,\\nshall hold the last soldier of the Revolution. And shall they ever meet\\nagain? Shall the patriots and soldiers of \\'76, the \"Immortal Band,\" as\\nhistory styles them, meet again in the amaranthine bowers of spotless\\npurity, of perfect bliss, of eternal glory? Shall theirs be the\\nChristian\\'s heaven, the kingdom of the Redeemer? The heathen points to his\\nfabulous Elysium as the paradise of the soldier and the sage. But the\\nChristian bows down with tears and sighs, for he knows that not many of\\nthe patriots, and statesmen, and warriors of Christian lands are the\\ndisciples of Jesus.\\n\\nBut we turn from Lafayette, the favorite of the old and the new world, to\\nthe peaceful benevolence, the unambitious achievements of Robert Raikes.\\nLet us imagine him to have been still alive, and to have visited our land,\\nto celebrate this day with us. No national ships would have been offered\\nto bear him, a nation\\'s guest, in the pride of the star-spangled banner,\\nfrom the bright shores of the rising, to the brighter shores of the\\nsetting sun. No cannon would have hailed him in the stern language of the\\nbattlefield, the fortunate champion of Freedom, in Europe and America. No\\nmartial music would have welcomed him in notes of rapture, as they rolled\\nalong the Atlantic, and echoed through the valley of the Mississippi. No\\nmilitary procession would have heralded his way through crowded streets,\\nthickset with the banner and the plume, the glittering saber and the\\npolished bayonet. No cities would have called forth beauty and fashion,\\nwealth and rank, to honor him in the ballroom and theater. No states would\\nhave escorted him from boundary to boundary, nor have sent their chief\\nmagistrate to do him homage. No national liberality would have allotted to\\nhim a nobleman\\'s domain and princely treasure. No national gratitude would\\nhave hailed him in the capitol itself, the nation\\'s guest, because the\\nnation\\'s benefactor; and have consecrated a battle ship, in memory of his\\nwounds and his gallantry.\\n\\nNot such would have been the reception of Robert Raikes, in the land of\\nthe Pilgrims and of Penn, of the Catholic, the Cavalier, and the Huguenot.\\nAnd who does not rejoice that it would be impossible thus to welcome this\\nprimitive Christian, the founder of Sunday schools? His heralds would be\\nthe preachers of the Gospel, and the eminent in piety, benevolence, and\\nzeal. His procession would number in its ranks the messengers of the Cross\\nand the disciples of the Savior, Sunday-school teachers and white-robed\\nscholars. The temples of the Most High would be the scenes of his triumph.\\nHomage and gratitude to him, would be anthems of praise and thanksgiving\\nto God.\\n\\nParents would honor him as more than a brother; children would reverence\\nhim as more than a father. The faltering words of age, the firm and sober\\nvoice of manhood, the silvery notes of youth, would bless him as a\\nChristian patron. The wise and the good would acknowledge him everywhere\\nas a national benefactor, as a patriot even to a land of strangers. He\\nwould have come a messenger of peace to a land of peace. No images of\\ncamps, and sieges, and battles; no agonies of the dying and the wounded;\\nno shouts of victory, or processions of triumph, would mingle with the\\nrecollections of the multitude who welcomed him. They would mourn over no\\ncommon dangers, trials, and calamities; for the road of duty has been to\\nthem the path of pleasantness, the way of peace. Their memory of the past\\nwould be rich in gratitude to God, and love to man; their enjoyment of the\\npresent would be a prelude to heavenly bliss; their prospects of the\\nfuture, bright and glorious as faith and hope. * * *\\n\\nSuch was the reception of Lafayette, the warrior; such would be that of\\nRobert Raikes, the Howard of the Christian church. And which is the nobler\\nbenefactor, patriot, and philanthropist? Mankind may admire and extol\\nLafayette more than the founder of the Sunday schools; but religion,\\nphilanthropy, and enlightened common sense must ever esteem Robert Raikes\\nthe superior of Lafayette. His are the virtues, the services, the\\nsacrifices of a more enduring and exalted order of being. His counsels and\\ntriumphs belong less to time than to eternity.\\n\\nThe fame of Lafayette is of this world; the glory of Robert Raikes is of\\nthe Redeemer\\'s everlasting kingdom. Lafayette lived chiefly for his own\\nage, and chiefly for his and our country; but Robert Raikes has lived for\\nall ages and all countries. Perhaps the historian and biographer may never\\ninterweave his name in the tapestry of national or individual renown. But\\nthe records of every single church honor him as a patron; the records of\\nthe universal Church, on earth as in heaven, bless him as a benefactor.\\n\\nThe time may come when the name of Lafayette will be forgotten; or when\\nthe star of his fame, no longer glittering in the zenith, shall be seen,\\npale and glimmering, on the verge of the horizon. But the name of Robert\\nRaikes shall never be forgotten; and the lambent flame of his glory is\\nthat eternal fire which rushed down from heaven to devour the sacrifice of\\nElijah. Let mortals then admire and imitate Lafayette more than Robert\\nRaikes. But the just made perfect, and the ministering spirits around the\\nthrone of God, have welcomed him as a fellow-servant of the same Lord; as\\na fellow-laborer in the same glorious cause of man\\'s redemption; as a\\ncoheir of the same precious promises and eternal rewards.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Armada, the great fleet sent out in 1588, by Philip II. of Spain,\\nfor the conquest of England, was defeated in the Channel by the English\\nand Dutch fleets.

FALL OF CARDINAL WOLSEY. (167)\\n\\nWolsey. Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!\\n        This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\\n        The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\\n        And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;\\n        The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\\n        And, when he thinks, good, easy man, full surely\\n        His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\\n        And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\\n        Like little, wanton boys that swim on bladders,\\n        This many summers in a sea of glory,\\n        But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\\n        At length broke under me, and now has left me,\\n        Weary and old with service, to the mercy\\n        Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.\\n        Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\\n        I feel my heart new open\\'d. Oh, how wretched\\n        Is that poor man that hangs on princes\\' favors!\\n        There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\\n        That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\\n        More pangs and fears than wars or women have:\\n        And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\\n        Never to hope again.\\n\\n                Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed.\\n\\n                        Why, how now, Cromwell!\\n\\nCrom. I have no power to speak, sir.\\nWol.                   What, amazed\\n      At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder,\\n      A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,\\n      I am fall\\'n indeed.\\nCrom.                  How does your grace?\\nWol.                                        Why, well;\\n      Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\\n      I know myself now; and I fed within me\\n      A peace above all earthly dignities,\\n      A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,\\n      I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,\\n      These ruin\\'d pillars, out of pity, taken\\n      A load would sink a navy!--too much honor:\\n      Oh, \\'t is a burthen, Cromwell, \\'tis a burthen,\\n      Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!\\nCrom. I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.\\nWol.  I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,\\n      Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,\\n      To endure more miseries, and greater far,\\n      Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.\\n      What news abroad?\\nCrom.                   The heaviest, and the worst,\\n      Is your displeasure with the king.\\nWol.                    God bless him!\\nCrom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen\\n      Lord chancellor in your place.\\nWol.                    That\\'s somewhat sudden:\\n      But he\\'s a learned man. May he continue\\n      Long in his highness\\' favor, and do justice\\n      For truth\\'s sake and his conscience; that his bones,\\n      When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,\\n      May have a tomb of orphans\\' tears wept on \\'em!\\n      What more?\\nCrom.         That Cranmer is return\\'d with welcome,\\n      Install\\'d lord archbishop of Canterbury.\\nWol.  That\\'s news indeed!\\nCrom.

There was the weight that pull\\'d me down. O Cromwell,\\n      The king has gone beyond me: all my glories\\n      In that one woman I have lost forever:\\n      No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,\\n      Or gild again the noble troops that waited\\n      Upon my smiles. Go! get thee from me! Cromwell;\\n      I am a poor, fall\\'n man, unworthy now\\n      To be thy lord and master: seek the king;\\n      That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him\\n      What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;\\n      Some little memory of me will stir him--\\n      I know his noble nature--not to let\\n      Thy hopeful service perish, too: good Cromwell,\\n      Neglect him not; make use now, and provide\\n      For thine own future safety.\\nCrom.                                   O my lord,\\n      Must I, then, leave you? Must I needs forego\\n      So good, so noble, and so true a master?\\n      Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,\\n      With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.\\n      The king shall have my service; but my prayers\\n      Forever and forever shall be yours.\\nWol.  Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear\\n      In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,\\n      Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.\\n      Let\\'s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;\\n      And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,\\n      And sleep in dull, cold marble, where no mention\\n      Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee;\\n      Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,\\n      And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,\\n      Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;\\n      A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.\\n      Mark but my fall, and that that ruin\\'d me.\\n      Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:\\n      By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,\\n      The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?\\n      Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;\\n      Corruption wins not more than honesty.\\n      Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,\\n      To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:\\n      Let all the ends thou aim\\'st at be thy country\\'s,\\n      Thy God\\'s, and truth\\'s; then, if thou fall\\'st, O Cromwell,\\n      Thou fall\\'st, a blessed martyr! Serve the king;\\n      And,--prithee, lead me in:\\n      There, take an inventory of all I have,\\n      To the last penny; \\'t is the king\\'s: my robe,\\n      And my integrity to Heaven, is all\\n      I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!\\n      Had I but served my God with half the zeal\\n      I served my king, He would not in mine age\\n      Have left me naked to mine enemies.\\nCrom. Good sir, have patience.\\nWol.                            So I have.

THE PHILOSOPHER. (171)\\n\\nJohn P. Kennedy, 1796-1870. This gentleman, eminent in American politics\\nand literature, was born in Baltimore, graduated at the College of\\nBaltimore, and died in the same city. He served several years in the\\nLegislature of his native state, and three terms in the United States\\nHouse of Representatives. He was Secretary of the Navy during a part of\\nPresident Fillmore\\'s administration, and was active in sending out the\\nfamous Japan expedition, and Dr. Kane\\'s expedition in search of Sir John\\nFranklin. Mr. Kennedy wrote several novels, as well as political and other\\npapers. His writings are marked by ease and freshness, The following\\nextract is from \"Swallow Barn,\" a series of sketches of early Virginia.\\n###\\n\\n\\nFrom the house at Swallow Barn there is to be seen, at no great distance,\\na clump of trees, and in the midst of these a humble building is\\ndiscernible, that seems to court the shade in which it is modestly\\nembowered. It is an old structure built of logs. Its figure is a cube,\\nwith a roof rising from all sides to a point, and surmounted by a wooden\\nweathercock, which somewhat resembles a fish and somewhat a fowl.\\n\\nThis little edifice is a rustic shrine devoted to Cadmus, and is under the\\ndominion of parson Chub. He is a plump, rosy old gentleman, rather short\\nand thickset, with the blood vessels meandering over his face like\\nrivulets,--a pair of prominent blue eyes, and a head of silky hair not\\nunlike the covering of a white spaniel. He may be said to be a man of\\njolly dimensions, with an evident taste for good living, sometimes sloven\\nin his attire, for his coat--which is not of the newest--is decorated with\\nsundry spots that are scattered over it in constellations. Besides this,\\nhe wears an immense cravat, which, as it is wreathed around his short\\nneck, forms a bowl beneath his chin, and--as Ned says--gives the parson\\'s\\nhead the appearance of that of John the Baptist upon a charger, as it is\\nsometimes represented in the children\\'s picture books. His beard is\\ngrizzled with silver stubble, which the parson reaps about twice a\\nweek--if the weather be fair.\\n\\nMr. Chub is a philosopher after the order of Socrates. He was an emigrant\\nfrom the Emerald Isle, where he suffered much tribulation in the\\ndisturbances, as they are mildly called, of his much-enduring country. But\\nthe old gentleman has weathered the storm without losing a jot of that\\nbroad, healthy benevolence with which Nature has enveloped his heart, and\\nwhose ensign she has hoisted in his face. The early part of his life had\\nbeen easy and prosperous, until the rebellion of 1798 stimulated his\\nrepublicanism into a fever, and drove the full-blooded hero headlong into\\na quarrel, and put him, in spite of his peaceful profession, to standing\\nby his pike in behalf of his principles. By this unhappy boiling over of\\nthe caldron of his valor, he fell under the ban of the ministers, and\\ntested his share of government mercy. His house was burnt over his head,\\nhis horses and hounds (for, by all accounts, he was a perfect Actaeon)\\nwere \"confiscate to the state,\" and he was forced to fly. This brought him\\nto America in no very compromising mood with royalty.\\n\\nHere his fortunes appear to have been various, and he was tossed to and\\nfro by the battledoor of fate, until he found a snug harbor at Swallow\\nBarn; where, some years ago, he sat down in that quiet repose which a\\nworried and badgered patriot is best fitted to enjoy.\\n\\nHe is a good scholar, and, having confined his readings entirely to the\\nlearning of the ancients, his republicanism is somewhat after the Grecian\\nmold. He has never read any politics of later date than the time of the\\nEmperor Constantine, not even a newspaper,--so that he may be said to have\\nbeen contemporary with AEschines rather than Lord Castlereagh--until that\\neventful epoch of his life when his blazing rooftree awakened him from his\\nanachronistical dream. This notable interruption, however, gave him but a\\nfeeble insight into the moderns, and he soon relapsed to Thucydides and\\nLivy, with some such glimmerings of the American Revolution upon his\\nremembrance as most readers have of the exploits of the first Brutus.\\n\\nThe old gentleman had a learned passion for folios. He had been a long\\ntime urging Meriwether to make some additions to his collections of\\nliterature, and descanted upon the value of some of the ancient authors as\\nfoundations, both moral and physical, to the library. Frank gave way to\\nthe argument, partly to gratify the parson, and partly from the\\nproposition itself having a smack that touched his fancy. The matter was\\ntherefore committed entirely to Mr. Chub, who forthwith set out on a\\nvoyage of exploration to the north. I believe he got as far as Boston. He\\ncertainly contrived to execute his commission with a curious felicity.\\nSome famous Elzevirs were picked up, and many other antiques that nobody\\nbut Mr. Chub would ever think of opening.\\n\\nThe cargo arrived at Swallow Burn in the dead of winter. During the\\ninterval between the parson\\'s return from his expedition and the coming of\\nthe books, the reverend little schoolmaster was in a remarkably unquiet\\nstate of body, which almost prevented him from sleeping: and it is said\\nthat the sight of the long-expected treasures had the happiest effect\\nupon him. There was ample accommodation for this new acquisition of\\nancient wisdom provided before its arrival, and Mr. Chub now spent a whole\\nweek in arranging the volumes on their proper shelves, having, as report\\naffirms, altered the arrangement at least seven times during that period.\\nEverybody wondered what the old gentleman was at, all this time; but it\\nwas discovered afterwards, that he was endeavoring to effect a\\ndistribution of the works according to a minute division of human science,\\nwhich entirely failed, owing to the unlucky accident of several of his\\ndepartments being without any volumes.\\n\\nAfter this matter was settled, he regularly spent his evenings in the\\nlibrary. Frank Meriwether was hardly behind the parson in this fancy, and\\ntook, for a short time, to abstruse reading. They both consequently\\ndeserted the little family circle every evening after tea, and might have\\ncontinued to do so all the winter but for a discovery made by Hazard.\\n\\nNed had seldom joined the two votaries of science in their philosophical\\nretirement, and it was whispered in the family that the parson was giving\\nFrank a quiet course of lectures in the ancient philosophy, for Meriwether\\nwas known to talk a great deal, about that time, of the old and new\\nAcademicians. But it happened upon one dreary winter night, during a\\ntremendous snowstorm, which was banging the shutters and doors of the\\nhouse so as to keep up a continual uproar, that Ned, having waited in the\\nparlor for the philosophers until midnight, set out to invade their\\nretreat--not doubting that he should find them deep in study. When he\\nentered the library, both candles were burning in their sockets, with\\nlong, untrimmed wicks; the fire was reduced to its last embers, and, in an\\narmchair on one side of the table, the parson was discovered in a sound\\nsleep over Jeremy Taylor\\'s \"Ductor Dubitantium,\" whilst Frank, in another\\nchair on the opposite side, was snoring over a folio edition of Montaigne.\\nAnd upon the table stood a small stone pitcher, containing a residuum of\\nwhisky punch, now grown cold. Frank started up in great consternation upon\\nhearing Ned\\'s footstep beside him, and, from that time, almost entirely\\ndeserted the library. Mr. Chub, however, was not so easily drawn away from\\nthe career of his humor, and still shows his hankering after his\\nleather-coated friends.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Cadmus is said to have taught the Greeks the use of the alphabet.\\n\\nSocrates (b. 469, d. 399 B.

(176)\\n\\nNot far advanced was morning day,\\nWhen Marmion did his troop array\\n  To Surrey\\'s camp to ride;\\nHe had safe conduct for his band,\\nBeneath the royal seal and hand,\\n  And Douglas gave a guide.\\n\\nThe train from out the castle drew,\\nBut Marmion stopped to bid adieu:\\n\"Though something I might plain,\" he said,\\n  \"Of cold respect to stranger guest,\\n  Sent hither by your king\\'s behest,\\nWhile in Tantallon\\'s towers I staid,\\n  Part we in friendship from your land,\\n  And, noble Earl, receive my hand.\"\\nBut Douglas round him drew his cloak,\\nFolded his arms, and thus he spoke:\\n  \"My manors, halls, and bowers shall still\\n  Be open, at my sovereign\\'s will,\\n    To each one whom he lists, howe\\'er\\n    Unmeet to be the owner\\'s peer.\\n  My castles are my king\\'s alone,\\n  From turret to foundation stone;\\n  The hand of Douglas is his own;\\n    And never shall, in friendly grasp,\\n    The hand of such as Marmion clasp.\"\\n\\nBurned Marmion\\'s swarthy cheek like fire,\\nAnd shook his very frame for ire;\\n  And--\"This to me!\" he said,--\\n\"An \\'t were not for thy hoary beard,\\nSuch hand as Marmion\\'s had not spared\\n  To cleave the Douglas\\' head!\\nAnd, first, I tell thee, haughty peer,\\nHe who does England\\'s message here,\\nAlthough the meanest in her state,\\nMay well, proud Angus, be thy mate:\\nAnd, Douglas, more, I tell thee here,\\n  Even in thy pitch of pride,\\nHere, in thy hold, thy vassals near,\\n  I tell thee, thou\\'rt defied!\\nAnd if thou said\\'st I am not peer\\nTo any lord in Scotland here,\\nLowland or Highland, far or near,\\n  Lord Angus, thou hast lied!\"\\n\\nOn the Earl\\'s cheek the flush of rage\\nO\\'ercame the ashen hue of age.\\nFierce he broke forth,--\"And dar\\'st thou then\\nTo beard the lion in his den,\\n  The Douglas in his hall?\\nAnd hop\\'st thou hence unscathed to go?\\nNo, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!\\nUp drawbridge, grooms,--what, warder, ho!\\n  Let the portcullis fall.\"\\nLord Marmion turned,--well was his need,--\\nAnd dashed the rowels in his steed,\\nLike arrow through the archway sprung;\\nThe ponderous gate behind him rung:\\nTo pass there was such scanty room,\\nThe bars, descending, razed his plume.\\n\\nThe steed along the drawbridge flies,\\nJust as it trembled on the rise;\\nNor lighter does the swallow skim\\nAlong the smooth lake\\'s level brim:\\nAnd when Lord Marmion reached his band\\nHe halts, and turns with clenched hand, [1]\\nAnd shout of loud defiance pours,\\nAnd shook his gauntlet at the towers.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note 1: clenched, pronounced \"clench-ed\".]\\n\\n\"Horse! horse!\" the Douglas cried, \"and chase!\"\\nBut soon he reined his fury\\'s pace:\\n\"A royal messenger he came,\\nThough most unworthy of the name.\\nSaint Mary mend my fiery mood!\\nOld age ne\\'er cools the Douglas\\' blood;\\nI thought to slay him where he stood.\\n\\'Tis pity of him, too,\" he cried;\\n\"Bold he can speak, and fairly ride;\\nI warrant him a warrior tried.\"\\nWith this his mandate he recalls,\\nAnd slowly seeks his castle halls.\\n                                   --Walter Scott.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: A man in armor on a galloping horse; he is waving a\\nclenched fist at a group behind a closed iron gate to a castle.]\\n\\n\\nNOTES:--In the poem from which this extract is taken, Marmion is\\nrepresented as an embassador sent by Henry VIII., king of England, to\\nJames IV., king of Scotland, with whom he was at war.

Douglas entertained him, treated\\nhim with the respect due to his office and to the honor of his sovereign,\\nyet he despised his private character. Marmion perceived this, and took\\numbrage at it, though he attempted to repress his resentment, and desired\\nto part in peace.

(178)\\n\\nAdelaide Anne Procter, 1825-1864, was the daughter of Bryan Waller\\nProcter, known in literature as \"Barry Cornwall.\" She is the author of\\nseveral volumes of poetry, and was a contributor to \"Good Words,\" \"All the\\nYear Round,\" and other London periodicals. Her works have been republished\\nin America.\\n###\\n\\n\\nDo not crouch to-day, and worship\\n  The dead Past, whose life is fled\\nHush your voice in tender reverence;\\n  Crowned he lies, but cold and dead:\\nFor the Present reigns, our monarch,\\n  With an added weight of hours;\\nHonor her, for she is mighty!\\n  Honor her, for she is ours!\\n\\nSee the shadows of his heroes\\n  Girt around her cloudy throne;\\nEvery day the ranks are strengthened\\n  By great hearts to him unknown;\\nNoble things the great Past promised,\\n  Holy dreams, both strange and new;\\nBut the Present shall fulfill them;\\n  What he promised, she shall do.\\n\\nShe inherits all his treasures,\\n  She is heir to all his fame,\\nAnd the light that lightens round her\\n  Is the luster of his name;\\nShe is wise with all his wisdom,\\n  Living on his grave she stands,\\nOn her brow she bears his laurels,\\n  And his harvest in her hands.\\n\\nCoward, can she reign and conquer\\n  If we thus her glory dim?\\nLet us fight for her as nobly\\n  As our fathers fought for him.\\nGod, who crowns the dying ages,\\n  Bids her rule, and us obey,\\nBids us cast our lives before her,\\n  Bids us serve the great To-day.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLIII. THE BAPTISM. (180)\\n\\nJohn Wilson, 1785-1854, a distinguished Scottish author, was born at\\nPaisley. When fifteen years of age, he entered the University of Glasgow;\\nbut, three years later, he became a member of Magdalen College, Oxford.\\nHere he attained eminence both as a student, and as a proficient in\\ngymnastic games and exercises. Soon after graduating, he purchased an\\nestate near Lake Windermere, and became a companion of Wordsworth and\\nSouthey; but he soon left his estate to reside in Edinburgh. In 1817, when\\n\"Blackwood\\'s Magazine\" was established in opposition to the \"Edinburgh\\nReview,\" he became chief contributor to that famous periodical. In its\\npages, he won his chief fame as a writer. In 1820, he succeeded Dr. Thomas\\nBrown as Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh;\\nthis position he held for thirty years. His \"Lights and Shadows of\\nScottish Life\" was published in 1822. This is a collection of pathetic and\\nbeautiful tales of domestic life in Scotland. His contributions to\\nBlackwood appeared over the pseudonym of \"Christopher North,\" or more\\nfamiliarly, \"Kit North.\" Professor Wilson was a man of great physical\\npower and of striking appearance. In character, he was vehement and\\nimpulsive; but his writings show that he possessed feelings of deep\\ntenderness.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe rite of baptism had not been performed for several months in the kirk\\nof Lanark. It was now the hottest time of persecution; and the inhabitants\\nof that parish found other places in which to worship God, and celebrate\\nthe ordinances of religion. It was now the Sabbath day, and a small\\ncongregation of about a hundred souls had met for divine service, in a\\nplace more magnificent than any temple that human hands had ever built to\\nDeity. The congregation had not assembled to the toll of the bell, but\\neach heart knew the hour and observed it; for there are a hundred sundials\\namong the hills, woods, moors, and fields; and the shepherd and the\\npeasant see the hours passing by them in sunshine and shadow.\\n\\nThe church in which they were assembled, was hewn by God\\'s hand out of the\\neternal rock. A river rolled its way through a mighty chasm of cliffs,\\nseveral hundred feet high, of which the one side presented enormous\\nmasses, and the other corresponding recesses, as if the great stone girdle\\nhad been rent by a convulsion. The channel was overspread with prodigious\\nfragments of rocks or large loose stones, some of them smooth and bare,\\nothers containing soil and verdure in their rents and fissures, and here\\nand there crowned with shrubs and trees. The eye could at once command a\\nlong-stretching vista, seemingly closed and shut up at both extremities by\\nthe coalescing cliffs. This majestic reach of river contained pools,\\nstreams, and waterfalls innumerable; and when the water was low--which was\\nnow the case, in the common drought--it was easy to walk up this scene\\nwith the calm, blue sky overhead, an utter and sublime solitude.\\n\\nOn looking up, the soul was bowed down by the feeling of that prodigious\\nheight of unscalable, and often overhanging, cliff. Between the channel\\nand the summit of the far extended precipices, were perpetually flying\\nrooks and wood pigeons, and now and then a hawk, filling the profound\\nabyss with their wild cawing, deep murmur, or shrilly shriek. Sometimes a\\nheron would stand erect and still, on some little stone island, or rise up\\nlike a white cloud along the black walls of the chasm, and disappear.\\nWinged creatures alone could inhabit this region. The fox and wild cat\\nchose more accessible haunts. Yet, here came the persecuted Christians and\\nworshiped God, whose hand hung over their head those magnificent pillars\\nand arches, scooped out those galleries from the solid rock, and laid at\\ntheir feet the calm water, in its transparent beauty, in which they could\\nsee themselves sitting, in reflected groups, with their Bibles in their\\nhands.\\n\\nHere, upon a semicircular ledge of rocks, over a narrow chasm, of which\\nthe tiny stream played in a murmuring waterfall, and divided the\\ncongregation into two equal parts, sat about a hundred persons, all\\ndevoutly listening to their minister, who stood before them on what might\\nhe called a small, natural pulpit of living stone. Up to it there led a\\nshort flight of steps, and over it waved the canopy of a tall, graceful\\nbirch tree. The pulpit stood in the middle of the channel, directly facing\\nthe congregation, and separated from them by the clear, deep, sparkling\\npool, into which the scarce-heard water poured over the blackened rock.\\nThe water, as it left the pool, separated into two streams, and flowed on\\neach side of that altar, thus placing it in an island, whose large, mossy\\nstones were richly embowered under the golden blossoms and green tresses\\nof the broom.\\n\\nAt the close of divine service, a row of maidens, all clothed in purest\\nwhite, came gliding off from the congregation, and, crossing the murmuring\\nstream on stepping stones, arranged themselves at the foot of the pulpit\\nwith those who were about to be baptized. Their devout fathers, just as\\nthough they had been in their own kirk, had been sitting there during\\nworship, and now stood up before the minister. The baptismal water, taken\\nfrom that pellucid pool, was lying, consecrated, in an appropriate\\nreceptacle, formed by the upright stones that composed one side of the\\npulpit, and the holy rite proceeded.\\n\\nSome of the younger ones in that semicircle kept gazing down into the\\npool, in which the whole scene was reflected; and now and then, in spite\\nof the grave looks and admonishing whispers of their elders, letting fall\\na pebble into the water, that they might judge of its depth, from the\\nlength of time that elapsed before the clear air bells lay sparkling on\\nthe agitated surface. The rite was over, and the religious service of the\\nday closed by a psalm. The mighty rocks hemmed in the holy sound, and sent\\nit in a more compact volume, clear, sweet, and strong, up to heaven. When\\nthe psalm ceased, an echo, like a spirit\\'s voice, was heard dying away,\\nhigh up among the magnificent architecture of the cliffs; and once more\\nmight be noticed in the silence, the reviving voice of the waterfall.\\n\\nJust then, a large stone fell from the top of the cliff into the pool, a\\nloud voice was heard, and a plaid was hung over on the point of a\\nshepherd\\'s staff. Their wakeful sentinel had descried danger, and this was\\nhis warning. Forthwith, the congregation rose. There were paths, dangerous\\nto unpracticed feet, along the ledges of the rocks, leading up to several\\ncaves and places of concealment. The more active and young assisted the\\nelder, more especially the old pastor, and the women with the infants; and\\nmany minutes had not elapsed, till not a living creature was visible in\\nthe channel of the stream, but all of them were hidden, or nearly so, in\\nthe clefts and caverns.\\n\\nThe shepherd who had given the alarm, had lain down again instantly in his\\nplaid on the greensward, upon the summit of these precipices. A party of\\nsoldiers was immediately upon him, and demanded what signals he had been\\nmaking, and to whom; when one of them, looking over the edge of the cliff,\\nexclaimed, \"See, see! Humphrey, We have caught the whole tabernacle of the\\nLord in a net at last. There they are, praising God among the stones of\\nthe river Mouse. These are the Cartland Craigs. A noble cathedral!\" \"Fling\\nthe lying sentinel over the cliffs. Here is a canting Covenanter for you,\\ndeceiving honest soldiers on the very Sabbath day. Over with him, over\\nwith him; out of the gallery into the pit.\" But the shepherd had vanished\\nlike a shadow, and, mixing with the tall, green broom and bushes, was\\nmaking his unseen way toward a wood. \"Satan has saved his servant; but\\ncome, my lads, follow me. I know the way down into the bed of the stream,\\nand the steps up to Wallace\\'s Cave. They are called, \\'kittle nine stanes;\\'\\nThe hunt\\'s up. We\\'ll all be in at the death. Halloo! my boys, halloo!\"\\n\\nThe soldiers dashed down a less precipitous part of the wooded banks, a\\nlittle below the \"craigs,\" and hurried up the channel. But when they\\nreached the altar where the old, gray-haired minister had been seen\\nstanding, and the rocks that had been covered with people, all was silent\\nand solitary; not a creature to be seen. \"Here is a Bible, dropped by some\\nof them,\" cried a soldier, and, with his foot, he spun it away into the\\npool. \"A bonnet, a bonnet,\" cried another; \"now for the pretty, sanctified\\nface, that rolled its demure eyes below it.\" But after a few jests and\\noaths, the soldiers stood still, eying with a kind of mysterious dread the\\nblack and silent walls of the rocks that hemmed them in, and hearing only\\nthe small voice of the stream that sent a profounder stillness through the\\nheart of that majestic solitude. \"What if these cowardly Covenanters\\nshould tumble down upon our heads pieces of rock, from their hiding\\nplaces! Advance, or retreat?\"\\n\\nThere was no reply; for a slight fear was upon every man. Musket or\\nbayonet could be of little use to men obliged to clamber up rocks, along\\nslender paths, leading they know not where. And they were aware that armed\\nmen nowadays worshiped God; men of iron hearts, who feared not the glitter\\nof the soldier\\'s arms, neither barrel nor bayonet; men of long stride,\\nfirm step, and broad breast, who, on the open field, would have overthrown\\nthe marshaled line, and gone first and foremost, if a city had to be taken\\nby storm.\\n\\nAs the soldiers were standing together irresolute, a noise came upon their\\nears like distant thunder, but even more appalling; and a slight current\\nof air, as if propelled by it, passed whispering along the sweetbriers,\\nand the broom, and the tresses of the birch trees. It came deepening, and\\nrolling, and roaring on; and the very Cartland Craigs shook to their\\nfoundation, as if in an earthquake. \"The Lord have mercy upon us! What is\\nthis?\" And down fell many of the miserable wretches on their knees, and\\nsome on their faces, upon the sharp-pointed rocks. Now, it was like the\\nsound of many myriads of chariots rolling on their iron axles down the\\nstrong channel of the torrent. The old, gray-haired minister issued from\\nthe mouth of Wallace\\'s Cave, and said, in a loud voice, \"The Lord God\\nterrible reigneth!\"\\n\\nA waterspout had burst up among the moorlands, and the river, in its\\npower, was at hand. There it came, tumbling along into that long reach of\\ncliffs, and, in a moment, filled it with one mass of waves. Huge, agitated\\nclouds of foam rode on the surface of a blood-red torrent. An army must\\nhave been swept off by that flood. The soldiers perished in a moment; but\\nhigh up in the cliffs, above the sweep of destruction, were the\\nCovenanters, men, women, and children, uttering prayers to God, unheard by\\nthemselves, in the raging thunder.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Lanark is a small town in the valley of the Clyde, in Scotland.

At the age of nineteen, she became the\\nwife of Mr. Seth D. Whitney. Her literary career began about 1856, since\\nwhich time she has written several novels and poems; a number of them\\nfirst appeared in the \"Atlantic Monthly.\" Her writings are marked by grace\\nand sprightliness.\\n###\\n\\n\\nLittle birds sit on the telegraph wires,\\n  And chitter, and flitter, and fold their wings;\\nMaybe they think that, for them and their sires,\\n  Stretched always, on purpose, those wonderful strings:\\nAnd, perhaps, the Thought that the world inspires,\\n  Did plan for the birds, among other things.\\n\\nLittle birds sit on the slender lines,\\n  And the news of the world runs under their feet,--\\nHow value rises, and how declines,\\n  How kings with their armies in battle meet,--\\nAnd, all the while, \\'mid the soundless signs,\\n  They chirp their small gossipings, foolish sweet.\\n\\nLittle things light on the lines of our lives,--\\n  Hopes, and joys, and acts of to-day,--\\nAnd we think that for these the Lord contrives,\\n  Nor catch what the hidden lightnings say.\\nYet, from end to end, His meaning arrives,\\n  And His word runs underneath, all the way.\\n\\nIs life only wires and lightning, then,\\n  Apart from that which about it clings?\\nAre the thoughts, and the works, and the prayers of men\\n  Only sparrows that light on God\\'s telegraph strings,\\nHolding a moment, and gone again?\\n  Nay; He planned for the birds, with the larger things.\\n\\n\\nXLV. OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH. (186)\\n\\nGardiner Spring, 1785-1873, was the son of Samuel Spring, D.D., who was\\npastor of a Congregational church in Newburyport, Massachusetts, for more\\nthan forty years. The son entered Yale College, and was valedictorian of\\nhis class in 1805. He studied law for a time; then went to Bermuda, where\\nhe taught nearly two years. On his return he completed his law studies,\\nand practiced his profession for more than a year. In 1810, having studied\\ntheology at Andover, he was ordained as pastor of the \"Brick Church\" in\\nNew York City. Here he remained till his death. He was elected president\\nof Dartmouth College, and also of Hamilton, but declined both positions.\\nHis works, embracing about twenty octavo volumes, have passed through\\nseveral editions; some have been translated into foreign languages, and\\nreprinted in Europe. As a preacher, Dr. Spring was eloquent and energetic.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe Sabbath lies at the foundation of all true morality. Morality flows\\nfrom principle. Let the principles of moral obligation become relaxed, and\\nthe practice of morality will not long survive the overthrow. No man can\\npreserve his own morals, no parent can preserve the morals of his\\nchildren, without the impressions of religious obligation.\\n\\nIf you can induce a community to doubt the genuineness and authenticity of\\nthe Scriptures; to question the reality and obligations of religion; to\\nhesitate, undeciding, whether there be any such thing as virtue or vice;\\nwhether there be an eternal state of retribution beyond the grave; or\\nwhether there exists any such being as God, you have broken down the\\nbarriers of moral virtue, and hoisted the flood gates of immorality and\\ncrime. I need not say that when a people have once done this, they can no\\nlonger exist as a tranquil and happy people. Every bond that holds society\\ntogether would be ruptured; fraud and treachery would take the place of\\nconfidence between man and man; the tribunals of justice would be scenes\\nof bribery and injustice; avarice, perjury, ambition, and revenge would\\nwalk through the land, and render it more like the dwelling of savage\\nbeasts than the tranquil abode of civilized and Christianized men.\\n\\nIf there is an institution which opposes itself to this progress of human\\ndegeneracy, and throws a shield before the interests of moral virtue in\\nour thoughtless and wayward world, it is the Sabbath. In the fearful\\nstruggle between virtue and vice, notwithstanding the powerful auxiliaries\\nwhich wickedness finds in the bosoms of men, and in the seductions and\\ninfluence of popular example, wherever the Sabbath has been suffered to\\nlive, the trembling interests of moral virtue have always been revered and\\nsustained. One of the principal occupations of this day is to illustrate\\nand enforce the great principles of sound morality. Where this sacred\\ntrust is preserved inviolate, you behold a nation convened one day in\\nseven for the purpose of acquainting themselves with the best moral\\nprinciples and precepts; and it can not be otherwise than that the\\nauthority of moral virtue, under such auspices, should be acknowledged and\\nfelt.\\n\\nWe may not, at once, perceive the effects which this weekly observance\\nproduces. Like most moral causes, it operates slowly; but it operates\\nsurely, and gradually weakens the power and breaks the yoke of profligacy\\nand sin. No villain regards the Sabbath. No vicious family regards the\\nSabbath. No immoral community regards the Sabbath. The holy rest of this\\never-memorable day is a barrier which is always broken down before men\\nbecome giants in sin. Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of\\nEngland, remarks that \"a corruption of morals usually follows a\\nprofanation of the Sabbath.\" It is an observation of Lord Chief Justice\\nHale, that \"of all the persons who were convicted of capital crimes, while\\nhe was on the bench, he found a few only who would not confess that they\\nbegan their career of wickedness by a neglect of the duties of the Sabbath\\nand vicious conduct on that day.\"\\n\\nThe prisons in our own land could probably tell us that they have scarcely\\na solitary tenant who had not broken over the restraints of the Sabbath\\nbefore he was abandoned to crime. You may enact laws for the suppression\\nof immorality, but the secret and silent power of the Sabbath constitutes\\na stronger shield to the vital interest of the community than any code of\\npenal statutes that ever was enacted. The Sabbath is the keystone of the\\narch which sustains the temple of virtue, which, however defaced, will\\nsurvive many a rude shock so long as the foundation remains firm.\\n\\nThe observance of the Sabbath is also most influential in securing\\nnational prosperity. The God of Heaven has said, \"Them that honor me I\\nwill honor,\" You will not often find a notorious Sabbath breaker a\\npermanently prosperous man; and a Sabbath-breaking community is never a\\nhappy or prosperous community. There is a multitude of unobserved\\ninfluences which the Sabbath exerts upon the temporal welfare of men. It\\npromotes the spirit of good order and harmony; it elevates the poor from\\nwant; it transforms squalid wretchedness; it imparts self-respect and\\nelevation of character; it promotes softness and civility of manners; it\\nbrings together the rich and the poor upon one common level in the house\\nof prayer; it purifies and strengthens the social affections, and makes\\nthe family circle the center of allurement and the source of instruction,\\ncomfort, and happiness. Like its own divine religion, \"it has the promise\\nof the life that now is and that which is to come,\" for men can not put\\nthemselves beyond the reach of hope and heaven so long as they treasure up\\nthis one command, \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\"\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Sir William Blackstone (b. 1723, d. 1780) was the son of a London\\nsilk mercer. He is celebrated as the author of the \"Commentaries on the\\nLaws of England,\" now universally used by law students both in England and\\nAmerica. He once retired from the law through failure to secure a\\npractice, but afterwards attained the highest honors in his profession.\\nSee biographical notice on page 410.\\n\\nSir Matthew Hale (b. 1609, d. 1676), was Lord Chief Justice of England\\nfrom 1671 to 1676.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVI.

CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS. (192)\\n\\nWashington Irving, 1783-1859. Among those whose works have enriched\\nAmerican literature, and have given it a place in the estimation of\\nforeigners, no name stands higher than that of Washington Irving. He was\\nborn in the city of New York; his father was a native of Scotland, and his\\nmother was English. He had an ordinary school education, and at the age of\\nsixteen began the study of law. Two of his older brothers were interested\\nin literary pursuits; and in his youth he studied the old English authors.\\nHe was also passionately fond of books of travel. At the age of nineteen,\\nhe began his literary career by writing for a paper published by his\\nbrother. In 1804 be made a voyage to the south of Europe. On his return he\\ncompleted his studies in law, but never practiced his profession.\\n\"Salmagundi,\" his first book (partly written by others), was published in\\n1807. This was followed, two years later, by \"Knickerbocker\\'s History of\\nNew York.\" Soon after, he entered into mercantile pursuits in company with\\ntwo brothers. At the close at the war with England he sailed again for\\nEurope, and remained abroad seventeen years. During his absence he formed\\nthe acquaintance of the most eminent literary men of his time, and wrote\\nseveral of his works; among them were: \"The Sketch Book,\" \"Bracebridge\\nHall,\" \"Tales of a Traveler,\" \"Life and Voyages of Columbus,\" and the\\n\"Conquest of Granada.\" On his return he made a journey west of the\\nMississippi, and gathered materials for several other books. From 1842 to\\n1846 he was Minister to Spain. On his return to America he established his\\nresidence at \"Sunnyside,\" near Tarrytown, on the Hudson, where he passed\\nthe last years of his life. A young lady to whom he was attached having\\ndied in early life, Mr. Irving never married.\\n\\nHis works are marked by humor, just sentiment, and elegance and\\ncorrectness of expression. They were popular both at home and abroad from\\nthe first, and their sale brought him a handsome fortune. The \"Life of\\nWashington,\" his last work, was completed in the same year in which he\\ndied.\\n###\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: See \"The Life of Columbus\" by Sir Arthur Helps,]\\n\\n\\nColumbus was a man of great and inventive genius. The operations of his\\nmind were energetic, but irregular; bursting forth, at times, with that\\nirresistible force which characterizes intellect of such an order. His\\nambition was lofty and noble, inspiring him with high thoughts and an\\nanxiety to distinguish himself by great achievements. He aimed at dignity\\nand wealth in the same elevated spirit with which he sought renown; they\\nwere to rise from the territories he should discover, and be commensurate\\nin importance.\\n\\nHis conduct was characterized by the grandeur of his views and the\\nmagnanimity of his spirit. Instead of ravaging the newly-found countries,\\nlike many of his cotemporary discoverers, who were intent only on\\nimmediate gain, he regarded them with the eyes of a legislator; he sought\\nto colonize and cultivate them, to civilize the natives, to build cities,\\nintroduce the useful arts, subject everything to the control of law,\\norder, and religion, and thus to found regular and prosperous empires.\\nThat he failed in this was the fault of the dissolute rabble which it was\\nhis misfortune to command, with whom all law was tyranny and all order\\noppression.\\n\\nHe was naturally irascible and impetuous, and keenly sensible to injury\\nand injustice; yet the quickness of his temper was counteracted by the\\ngenerosity and benevolence of his heart. The magnanimity of his nature\\nshone forth through all the troubles of his stormy career. Though\\ncontinually outraged in his dignity, braved in his authority, foiled in\\nhis plans, and endangered in his person by the seditions of turbulent and\\nworthless men, and that, too, at times when suffering under anguish of\\nbody and anxiety of mind enough to exasperate the most patient, yet he\\nrestrained his valiant and indignant spirit, and brought himself to\\nforbear, and reason, and even to supplicate. Nor can the reader of the\\nstory of his eventful life fail to notice how free he was from all feeling\\nof revenge, how ready to forgive and forget on the least sign of\\nrepentance and atonement. He has been exalted for his skill in controlling\\nothers, but far greater praise is due to him for the firmness he displayed\\nin governing himself.\\n\\nHis piety was genuine and fervent. Religion mingled with the whole course\\nof his thoughts and actions, and shone forth in his most private and\\nunstudied writings. Whenever he made any great discovery he devoutly\\nreturned thanks to God. The voice of prayer and the melody of praise rose\\nfrom his ships on discovering the new world, and his first action on\\nlanding was to prostrate himself upon the earth and offer up thanksgiving.\\nAll his great enterprises were undertaken in the name of the Holy Trinity,\\nand he partook of the holy sacrament previous to embarkation. He observed\\nthe festivals of the church in the wildest situations. The Sabbath was to\\nhim a day of sacred rest, on which he would never sail from a port unless\\nin case of extreme necessity. The religion thus deeply seated in his soul\\ndiffused a sober dignity and a benign composure over his whole deportment;\\nhis very language was pure and guarded, and free from all gross or\\nirreverent expressions.\\n\\nA peculiar trait in his rich and varied character remains to be noticed;\\nnamely, that ardent and enthusiastic imagination which threw a\\nmagnificence over his whole course of thought. A poetical temperament is\\ndiscernible throughout all his writings and in all his actions. We see it\\nin all his descriptions of the beauties of the wild land he was\\ndiscovering, in the enthusiasm with which he extolled the blandness of the\\ntemperature, the purity of the atmosphere, the fragrance of the air, \"full\\nof dew and sweetness,\" the verdure of the forests, the grandeur of the\\nmountains, and the crystal purity of the running streams. It spread a\\nglorious and golden world around him, and tinged everything with its own\\ngorgeous colors.\\n\\nWith all the visionary fervor of his imagination, its fondest dreams fell\\nshort of the reality. He died in ignorance of the real grandeur of his\\ndiscovery. Until his last breath, he entertained the idea that he had\\nmerely opened a new way to the old resorts of opulent commerce, and had\\ndiscovered some of the wild regions of the East. What visions of glory\\nwould have broken upon his mind could he have known that he had indeed\\ndiscovered a new continent equal to the old world in magnitude, and\\nseparated by two vast oceans from all the earth hitherto known by\\ncivilized man! How would his magnanimous spirit have been consoled amid\\nthe afflictions of age and the cares of penury, the neglect of a fickle\\npublic and the injustice of an ungrateful king, could he have anticipated\\nthe splendid empires which would arise in the beautiful world he had\\ndiscovered, and the nations, and tongues, and languages which were to fill\\nits land with his renown, and to revere and bless his name to the latest\\nposterity!\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--Christopher Columbus (b. 1436, d. 1506) was the son of a wool\\ncomber of Genoa. At the age of fifteen he became a sailor, and in his\\nvoyages visited England, Iceland, the Guinea coast, and the Greek Isles.\\nHe was an earnest student of navigation, of cosmography, and of books of\\ntravel; thus he thoroughly prepared himself for the great undertaking\\nwhich led to the discovery of America. He struggled against every\\ndiscouragement for almost ten years before he could persuade a sovereign\\nto authorize and equip his expedition.\\n\\n\\n\\nXLVIII. \"HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP.\" (195)\\n\\nElizabeth Barrett Browning, 1809-1861, was born in London, married\\nthe poet Robert Browning in 1846, and afterwards resided in Italy most of\\nthe time till her death, which occurred at Florence. She was thoroughly\\neducated in severe and masculine studies, and began to write at a very\\nearly age. Her \"Essay on Mind,\" a metaphysical and reflective poem, was\\nwritten at the age of sixteen. She wrote very rapidly, and her friend, Miss\\nMitford, tells us that \"Lady Geraldine\\'s Courtship,\" containing ninety-\\nthree stanzas, was composed in twelve hours! She published several other\\nlong poems, \"Aurora Leigh\" being one of the most highly finished. Mrs.\\nBrowning is regarded as one of the most able female poets of modern\\ntimes; but her writings are often obscure, and some have doubted whether\\nshe always clearly conceived what she meant to express. She had a warm\\nsympathy with all forms of suffering and distress. \"He Giveth his Beloved\\nSleep\" is one of the most beautiful of her minor poems. The thought is an\\namplification of verse 2d of Psalm cxxvii.\\n###\\n\\n\\nOf all the thoughts of God that are\\nBorne inward unto souls afar,\\n  Along the Psalmist\\'s music deep,\\nNow tell me if that any is,\\nFor gift or grace, surpassing this,--\\n  \"He giveth his beloved, sleep!\"\\n\\nWhat would we give to our beloved?\\nThe hero\\'s heart to be unmoved,\\n  The poet\\'s star-tuned harp, to sweep,\\nThe patriot\\'s voice, to teach and rouse,\\nThe monarch\\'s crown, to light the brows?--\\n  \"He giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\nWhat do we give to our beloved?\\nA little faith all undisproved,\\n  A little dust to overweep,\\nAnd bitter memories to make\\nThe whole earth blasted for our sake,--\\n  \"He giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\n\"Sleep soft, beloved!\" we sometimes say,\\nBut have no tune to charm away\\n  Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep.\\nBut never doleful dream again\\nShall break his happy slumber when\\n  \"He giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\nO earth, so full of dreary noises!\\nO men, with wailing in your voices!\\n  O delve\\'d gold, the wailers heap!\\nO strife, O curse, that o\\'er it fall!\\nGod strikes a silence through you all,\\n  And \"giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\nHis dews drop mutely on the hill;\\nHis cloud above it saileth still,\\n  Though on its slope men sow and reap.\\nMore softly than the dew is shed,\\nOr cloud is floated overhead,\\n  \"He giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\nAy, men may wonder while they scan\\nA living, thinking, feeing man,\\n  Confirmed in such a rest to keep;\\nBut angels say--and through the word\\nI think their happy smile is heard--\\n  \"He giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\nFor me my heart, that erst did go\\nMost like a tired child at a show,\\n  That sees through tears the mummers leap,\\nWould now its wearied vision close,\\nWould childlike on his love repose\\n  Who \"giveth his beloved, sleep.\"\\n\\nAnd friends, dear friends,--when it shall be\\nThat this low breath is gone from me,\\n  And round my bier ye come to weep,\\nLet one most loving of you all\\nSay, \"Not a tear must o\\'er her fall;\\n  \\'He giveth his beloved, sleep.\\' \"\\n\\n\\n\\nXLIX. DESCRIPTION OF A SIEGE. (197)\\n\\n\"The skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are\\nadvanced from its dark shadow.\" \"Under what banner?\" asked Ivanhoe. \"Under\\nno ensign which I can observe,\" answered Rebecca. \"A singular novelty,\"\\nmuttered the knight, \"to advance to storm such a castle without pennon or\\nbanner displayed. Seest thou who they be that act as leaders?\" \"A knight\\nclad in sable armor is the most conspicuous,\" said the Jewess: \"he alone\\nis armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the direction of all\\naround him.\"\\n\\n\"Seem there no other leaders?\" exclaimed the anxious inquirer. \"None of\\nmark and distinction that I can behold from this station,\" said Rebecca,\\n\"but doubtless the other side of the castle is also assailed. They seem,\\neven now, preparing to advance. God of Zion protect us! What a dreadful\\nsight! Those who advance first bear huge shields and defenses made of\\nplank: the others follow, bending their bows as they come on. They raise\\ntheir bows! God of Moses, forgive the creatures thou hast made!\"\\n\\nHer description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault,\\nwhich was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once answered by a\\nflourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which, mingled with\\nthe deep and hollow clang of the kettledrums, retorted in notes of\\ndefiance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of both parties augmented\\nthe fearful din, the assailants crying, \"Saint George, for merry England!\"\\nand the Normans answering them with loud cries of \"Onward, De Bracy! Front\\nde Boeuf, to the rescue!\"\\n\\n\"And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,\" exclaimed Ivanhoe, \"while the\\ngame that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of others!\\nLook from the window once again, kind maiden, and tell me if they yet\\nadvance to the storm.\" With patient courage, strengthened by the interval\\nwhich she had employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the\\nlattice, sheltering herself, however, so as not to be exposed to the\\narrows of the archers. \"What dost thou see, Rebecca?\" again demanded the\\nwounded knight. \"Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to\\ndazzle mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.\" \"That can not\\nendure,\" said Ivanhoe. \"If they press not right on, to carry the castle by\\nforce of arms, the archery may avail but little against stone walls and\\nbulwarks. Look for the knight in dark armor, fair Rebecca, and see how he\\nbears himself; for as the leader is, so will his followers be.\"\\n\\n\"I see him not,\" said Rebecca. \"Foul craven!\" exclaimed Ivanhoe; \"does he\\nblench from the helm when the wind blows highest?\" \"He blenches not! he\\nblenches not!\" said Rebecca; \"I see him now: he leads a body of men close\\nunder the outer barrier of the barbacan. They pull down the piles and\\npalisades; they hew down the barriers with axes. His high black plume\\nfloats abroad over the throng like a raven over the field of the slain.\\nThey have made a breach in the barriers, they rush in, they are thrust\\nback! Front de Boeuf heads the defenders. I see his gigantic form above\\nthe press. They throng again to the breach, and the pass is disputed, hand\\nto hand, and man to man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce\\ntides, the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds;\" and she turned\\nher head from the window as if unable longer to endure a sight so\\nterrible.\\n\\nSpeedily recovering her self-control, Rebecca again looked forth, and\\nalmost immediately exclaimed, \"Holy prophets of the law! Front de Boeuf\\nand the Black Knight fight hand to hand on the breach, amid the roar of\\ntheir followers, who watch the progress of the strife. Heaven strike with\\nthe cause of the oppressed and of the captive!\" She then uttered a loud\\nshriek, and exclaimed, \"He is down! he is down!\" \"Who is down!\" cried\\nIvanhoe; \"for our dear Lady\\'s sake, tell me which has fallen!\" \"The Black\\nKnight,\" answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again shouted with\\njoyful eagerness--\"But no! but no! the name of the Lord of Hosts be\\nblessed! he is on foot again, and fights as if there were twenty men\\'s\\nstrength in his single arm--his sword is broken--he snatches an ax from a\\nyeoman--he presses Front de Boeuf, blow on blow--the giant stoops and\\ntotters like an oak under the steel of the woodman--he falls-he falls!\"\\n\"Front de Boeuf?\" exclaimed Ivanhoe. \"Front de Boeuf,\" answered the\\nJewess; \"his men rush to the rescue, headed by the haughty Templar,\\n--their united force compels the champion to pause--they drag Front de\\nBoeuf within the walls.\"\\n\\n\"The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?\" said Ivanhoe. \"They\\nhave--they have--and they press the besieged hard upon the outer wall;\\nsome plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and endeavor to ascend upon the\\nshoulders of each other; down go stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon\\ntheir heads, and as fast as they bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men\\nsupply their places in the assault. Great God! hast thou given men thine\\nown image that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their\\nbrethren!\" \"Think not of that,\" replied Ivanhoe; \"this is no time for such\\nthoughts. Who yield? Who push their way?\"\\n\\n\"The ladders are thrown down,\" replied Rebecca, shuddering; \"the soldiers\\nlie groveling under them like crushed reptiles; the besieged have the\\nbetter.\" \"Saint George strike for us!\" said the knight; \"do the false\\nyeomen give way?\" \"No,\" exclaimed Rebecca, \"they bear themselves right\\nyeomanly; the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge ax; the\\nthundering blows which he deals, you may hear them above all the din and\\nshouts of the battle; stones and beams are hailed down on the brave\\nchampion; he regards them no more than if they were thistle down and\\nfeathers.\"\\n\\n\"Saint John of Acre!\" said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his couch,\\n\"methought there was but one man in England that might do such a deed.\"\\n\"The postern gate shakes,\" continued Rebecca; \"it crashes--it is\\nsplintered by his powerful blows--they rush in--the outwork is won! O God!\\nthey hurry the defenders from the battlements--they throw them into the\\nmoat! O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no longer!\"\\n\"The bridge--the bridge which communicates with the castle--have they won\\nthat pass?\" exclaimed Ivanhoe. \"No,\" replied Rebecca; \"the Templar has\\ndestroyed the plank on which they crossed--few of the defenders escaped\\nwith him into the castle--the shrieks and cries which you hear, tell the\\nfate of the others. Alas! I see that it is still more difficult to look\\nupon victory than upon battle.\"\\n\\n\"What do they now, maiden?\" said Ivanhoe; \"look forth yet again--this is\\nno time to faint at bloodshed.\" \"It is over, for a time,\" said Rebecca;\\n\"our friends strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have\\nmastered.\" \"Our friends,\" said Ivanhoe, \"will surely not abandon an\\nenterprise so gloriously begun, and so happily attained; Oh no! I will put\\nmy faith in the good knight whose ax has rent heart of oak and bars of\\niron. Singular,\" he again muttered to himself, \"if there can be two who\\nare capable of such achievements. It is,--it must be Richard Coeur de\\nLion.\"\\n\\n\"Seest thou nothing else. Rebecca, by which the Black Knight may be\\ndistinguished?\" \"Nothing,\" said the Jewess, \"all about him is as black as\\nthe wing of the night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further;\\nbut having once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I\\ncould know him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as\\nif he were summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength; it\\nseems as if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every\\nblow which he deals upon his enemies. God forgive him the sin of\\nbloodshed! it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and heart\\nof one man can triumph over hundreds.\"\\n                                                          -- Walter Scott.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Ivanhoe, a wounded knight, and Rebecca, a Jewess, had been\\nimprisoned in the castle of Reginald Front de Boeuf. The friends of the\\nprisoners undertake their rescue. At the request of Ivanhoe, who is unable\\nto leave his couch, Rebecca takes her stand near a window overlooking the\\napproach to the castle, and details to the knight the incidents of the\\ncontest as they take place. Front de Boeuf and his garrison were Normans;\\nthe besiegers, Saxons.\\n\\nThe castles of this time (twelfth century) usually consisted of a keep, or\\ncastle proper, surrounded at some distance by two walls, one within the\\nother. Each wall was encircled on its outer side by a moat, or ditch,\\nwhich was filled with water, and was crossed by means of a drawbridge.\\nBefore the main entrance of the outer wall was an outwork called the\\nbarbacan, which was a high wall surmounted by battlements and turrets,\\nbuilt to defend the gate and drawbridge. Here, also, were placed barriers\\nof palisades, etc., to impede the advance of an attacking force. The\\npostern gate was small, and was usually some distance from the ground; it\\nwas used for the egress of messengers during a siege;\\n\\n\\nL. MARCO BOZZARIS. (202)\\n\\nFitz-Greene Halleck, 1790--1867, was born in Guilford, Connecticut. At the\\nage of eighteen he entered a banking house in New York, where he remained\\na long time. For many years he was bookkeeper and assistant in business\\nfor John Jacob Astor. Nearly all his poems were written before he was\\nforty years old, several of them in connection with his friend Joseph\\nRodman Drake. His \"Young America,\" however, was written but a few years\\nbefore his death. Mr. Halleck\\'s poetry is carefully finished and musical;\\nmuch of it is sportive, and some satirical. No one of his poems is better\\nknown than \"Marco Bozzaris.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nAt midnight, in his guarded tent,\\n  The Turk was dreaming of the hour\\nWhen Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,\\n  Should tremble at his power.\\nIn dreams, through camp and court he bore\\nThe trophies of a conqueror;\\n  In dreams, his song of triumph heard;\\nThen wore his monarch\\'s signet ring;\\nThen pressed that monarch\\'s throne--a king:\\nAs wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,\\n  As Eden\\'s garden bird.\\n\\nAt midnight, in the forest shades,\\n  Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,\\nTrue as the steel of their tried blades,\\n  Heroes in heart and hand.\\nThere had the Persian\\'s thousands stood,\\nThere had the glad earth drunk their blood,\\n  On old Plataea\\'s day:\\nAnd now there breathed that haunted air,\\nThe sons of sires who conquered there,\\nWith arms to strike, and soul to dare,\\n  As quick, as far as they.\\n\\nAn hour passed on--the Turk awoke;\\n  That bright dream was his last:\\nHe woke--to hear his sentries shriek,\\n  \"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!\"\\nHe woke--to die mid flame and smoke,\\nAnd shout, and groan, and saber stroke,\\n  And death shots falling thick and fast\\nAs lightnings from the mountain cloud;\\nAnd heard, with voice as trumpet loud,\\n  Bozzaris cheer his band:\\n\"Strike--till the last armed foe expires;\\nStrike--for your altars and your fires;\\nStrike--for the green graves of your sires;\\n  God--and your native land!\"\\n\\nThey fought--like brave men, long and well;\\n  They piled that ground with Moslem slain;\\nThey conquered--but Bozzaris fell,\\n  Bleeding at every vein.\\nHis few surviving comrades saw\\nHis smile, when rang their proud hurrah,\\n  And the red field was won:\\nThen saw in death his eyelids close\\nCalmly, as to a night\\'s repose,\\n  Like flowers at set of sun.\\n\\nCome to the bridal chamber, Death!\\n  Come to the mother, when she feels\\nFor the first time her firstborn\\'s breath;\\n  Come when the blessed seals\\nThat close the pestilence are broke,\\nAnd crowded cities wail its stroke;\\nCome in consumption\\'s ghastly form,\\nThe earthquake\\'s shock, the ocean storm;\\nCome when the heart beats high and warm\\n  With banquet song, and dance, and wine:\\nAnd thou art terrible--the tear,\\nThe groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,\\nAnd all we know, or dream, or fear\\n  Of agony, are thine.\\nBut to the hero, when his sword\\n  Has won the battle for the free,\\nThy voice sounds like a prophet\\'s word;\\nAnd in its hollow tones are heard\\n  The thanks of millions yet to be.\\n\\nBozzaris! with the storied brave\\n  Greece nurtured in her glory\\'s time,\\nRest thee--there is no prouder grave\\n  Even in her own proud clime.\\n  We tell thy doom without a sigh,\\nFor thou art Freedom\\'s, now, and Fame\\'s.\\nOne of the few, the immortal names,\\n  That were not born to die.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Marco Bozzaris (b. about 1790, d. 1823) was a famous Greek\\npatriot. His family were Suliotes, a people inhabiting the Suli Mountains,\\nand bitter enemies of the Turks. Bozzaris was engaged in war against the\\nlatter nearly all his life, and finally fell in a night attack upon their\\ncamp near Carpenisi.

This gifted poet was the son\\nof a profligate father and of a fickle and passionate mother. He was\\nafflicted with lameness from his birth; and, although he succeeded to his\\ngreat-uncle\\'s title at ten years of age, he inherited financial\\nembarrassment with it. These may be some of the reasons for the morbid and\\nwayward character of the youthful genius. It is certain that he was not\\nlacking in affection, nor in generosity. In his college days, at\\nCambridge, he was willful and careless of his studies. \"Hours of\\nIdleness,\" his first book, appeared in 1807. It was severely treated by\\nthe \"Edinburgh Review,\" which called forth his \"English Bards and Scotch\\nReviewers,\" in 1809. Soon after, he went abroad for two years; and, on his\\nreturn, published the first two cantos of \"Childe Harold\\'s Pligrimage,\" a\\nwork that made him suddenly famous. He married in 1815, but separated from\\nhis wife after one year. Soured and bitter, he now left England, purposing\\nnever to return. He spent most of the next seven years in Italy, where\\nmost of his poems were written. The last year of his life was spent in\\nGreece, aiding in her struggle for liberty against the Turks. He died at\\nMissolonghi. As a man, Byron was impetuous, morbid and passionate. He was\\nundoubtedly dissipated and immoral, but perhaps to a less degree than has\\nsometimes been asserted. As a poet, he possessed noble powers, and he has\\nwritten much that will last; in general, however, his poetry is not\\nwholesome, and his fame is less than it once was.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe isles of Greece! the isles of Greece!\\n  Where burning Sappho loved and sung,\\nWhere grew the arts of war and peace,--\\n  Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!\\nEternal summer gilds them yet,\\nBut all, except their sun, is set.\\n\\nThe Scian and the Teian muse,\\n  The hero\\'s harp, the lover\\'s lute,\\nHave found the fame your shores refuse;\\n  Their place of birth alone is mute\\nTo sounds which echo further west\\nThan your sires\\' \"Islands of the Blest.\"\\n\\nThe mountains look on Marathon,\\n  And Marathon looks on the sea;\\nAnd musing there an hour alone,\\n  I dreamed that Greece might still be free;\\nFor, standing on the Persian\\'s grave,\\nI could not deem myself a slave.\\n\\nA king sat on the rocky brow\\n  Which looks o\\'er sea-born Salamis;\\nAnd ships, by thousands, lay below,\\n  And men in nations,--all were his!\\nHe counted them at break of day,--\\nAnd when the sun set, where were they?\\n\\nAnd where are they?

C. Delos is one of the Grecian Archipelago, and is of volcanic\\norigin. The ancient Greeks believed that it rose from the sea at a stroke\\nfrom Neptune\\'s trident, and was moored fast to the bottom by Jupiter. It\\nwas the supposed birthplace of Phoebus, or Apollo. The island of Chios, or\\nScios, is one of the places which claim to be the birthplace of Homer.\\nTeios, or Teos, a city in Ionia, is the birthplace of the Greek poet\\nAnacreon. The Islands of the Blest, mentioned in ancient poetry, were\\nimaginary islands in the west, where, it was believed, the favorites of\\nthe gods were conveyed without dying.\\n\\nAt Marathon. (490 B. C.), on the east coast, of Greece, 11,000 Greeks,\\nunder the generalship of Miltiades, routed 110,000 Persians. The island of\\nSalamis lies very near the Greek coast: in the narrow channel between, the\\nGreek fleet almost destroyed (480 B.C.) that of Xerxes, the Persian king,\\nwho witnessed the contest from a throne on the mountain side. Thermopylae\\nis a narrow mountain pass in Greece, where Leonidas, with 300 Spartans and\\nabout 1,100 other Greeks, held the entire Persian army in check until\\nevery Spartan, except one, was slain. Samos is one of the Grecian\\nArchipelago, noted for its cultivation of the vine and olive.\\n\\nA Bacchanal was a disciple of Bacchus, the god of wine. Pyrrhus was a\\nGreek, and one of the greatest generals of the world. The phalanx was an\\nalmost invincible arrangement of troops, massed in close array, with their\\nshields overlapping one another, and their spears projecting; this form of\\nmilitary tactics was peculiar to the Greeks.\\n\\nPolycrates seized the island of Samos, and made himself tyrant: he was\\nentrapped and crucified in 522 B. C. Chersonese is the ancient name for a\\npeninsula. Sunium is the name of a promontory southeast of Athens.\\n\\n\\n\\nLII. NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS. (209)\\n\\nCharles Sprague, 1791-1875, was born in Boston, and received his education\\nin the public schools of that city. For sixteen years he was engaged in\\nmercantile pursuits, as clerk and partner. In 1820 he became teller in a\\nbank; and, from 1825, he filled the office of cashier of the Globe Bank\\nfor about forty years. In 1829 be gave his most famous poem, \"Curiosity,\"\\nbefore the Phi Beta Kappa society, in Cambridge. An active man of business\\nall his days, he has written but little either in prose or poetry, but\\nthat little is excellent in quality, graceful, and pleasing.\\n\\nThe address from which this extract is taken, was delivered before the\\ncitizens of Boston, July 4th, 1825.\\n###\\n\\n\\nNot many generations ago, where you now sit, encircled with all that\\nexalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the wind\\nand the wild fox dug his hole unscared. Here lived and loved another race\\nof beings. Beneath the same sun that rolls over your head, the Indian\\nhunter pursued the panting deer; gazing on the same moon that smiles for\\nyou, the Indian lover wooed his dusky mate. Here the wigwam blaze beamed\\non the tender and helpless, and the council fire glared on the wise and\\ndaring. Now they dipped their noble limbs in your sedgy lakes, and now\\nthey paddled the light canoe along your rocky shores. Here they warred;\\nthe echoing whoop, the bloody grapple, the defying death song, all were\\nhere; and when the tiger strife was over, here curled the smoke of peace.\\n\\nHere, too, they worshiped; and from many a dark bosom went up a fervent\\nprayer to the Great Spirit. He had not written his laws for them on tables\\nof stone, but he had traced them on the tables of their hearts. The poor\\nchild of nature knew not the God of Revelation, but the God of the\\nuniverse he acknowledged in everything around. He beheld him in the star\\nthat sank in beauty behind his lonely dwelling; in the sacred orb that\\nflamed on him from his midday throne; in the flower that snapped in the\\nmorning breeze; in the lofty pine that defied a thousand whirlwinds; in\\nthe timid warbler that never left its native grove; in the fearless eagle,\\nwhose untired pinion was wet in clouds; in the worm that crawled at his\\nfeet; and in his own matchless form, glowing with a spark of that light,\\nto whose mysterious source he bent in humble though blind adoration.\\n\\nAnd all this has passed away. Across the ocean came a pilgrim bark,\\nbearing the seeds of life and death. The former were sown for you; the\\nlatter sprang up in the path of the simple native. Two hundred years have\\nchanged the character of a great continent, and blotted forever from its\\nface a whole, peculiar people. Art has usurped the bowers of nature, and\\nthe anointed children of education have been too powerful for the tribes\\nof the ignorant. Here and there a stricken few remain; but how unlike\\ntheir bold, untamable progenitors. The Indian of falcon glance and lion\\nbearing, the theme of the touching ballad, the hero of the pathetic tale\\nis gone, and his degraded offspring crawls upon the soil where he walked\\nin majesty, to remind us how miserable is man when the foot of the\\nconqueror is on his neck.\\n\\nAs a race they have withered from the land. Their arrows are broken, their\\nsprings are dried up, their cabins are in the dust. Their council fire has\\nlong since gone out on the shore, and their war cry is fast fading to the\\nuntrodden west. Slowly and sadly they climb the distant mountains, and\\nread their doom in the setting sun. They are shrinking before the mighty\\ntide which is pressing them away; they must soon hear the roar of the last\\nwave which will settle over them forever. Ages hence, the inquisitive\\nwhite man, as he stands by some growing city, will ponder on the structure\\nof their disturbed remains, and wonder to what manner of persons they\\nbelonged. They will live only in the songs and chronicles of their\\nexterminators. Let these be faithful to their rude virtues as men, and pay\\ndue tribute to their unhappy fate as a people.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIII. LOCHIEL\\'S WARNING. (211)\\n\\nThomas Campbell, 1777-1844, was a descendant of the famous clan of\\nCampbells, in Kirnan, Scotland, and was born at Glasgow. At the age of\\nthirteen he entered the university in that city, from which he graduated\\nwith distinction, especially as a Greek scholar; his translations of Greek\\ntragedy were considered without parallel in the history of the university.\\nDuring the first year after graduation, he wrote several poems of minor\\nimportance. He then removed to Edinburgh and adopted literature as his\\nprofession; here his \"Pleasures of Hope\" was published in 1799, and\\nachieved immediate success. He traveled extensively on the continent, and\\nduring his absence wrote \"Lochiel\\'s Warning,\" \"Hohenlinden,\" and other\\nminor poems. In 1809 he published \"Gertrude of Wyoming;\" from 1820 to 1830\\nhe edited the \"New Monthly Magazine.\" In 1826 he was chosen lord rector of\\nthe University of Glasgow, to which office he was twice reelected. He was\\nactive in founding the University of London. During the last years of his\\nlife he produced but little of note. He died at Boulogne, in France.\\nDuring most of his life he was in straitened pecuniary circumstances, and\\nill-health and family afflictions cast a melancholy over his later years.\\nHis poems were written with much care, and are uniformly smooth and\\nmusical.\\n###\\n\\n\\nSeer.

He\\nespoused the cause of Charles Stuart, called the Pretender, who claimed\\nthe British throne. In the preceding piece, he is supposed to be marching\\nwith the warriors of his clan to join Charles\\'s army. On his way he is met\\nby a Seer, who having, according to the popular superstition, the gift of\\nsecond-sight, or prophecy, forewarns him of the disastrous event of the\\nenterprise, and exhorts him to return home and avoid the destruction which\\ncertainly awaits him, and which afterward fell upon him at the battle of\\nCulloden, in 1746. In this battle the Highlanders were commanded by\\nCharles in person, and the English by the Duke of Cumberland. The\\nHighlanders wore completely routed, and the Pretender\\'s rebellion brought\\nto a close. He himself shortly afterward made a narrow escape by water\\nfrom the west of Scotland; hence the reference to the fugitive king.\\n\\nAlbin is the poetic name of Scotland, more particularly the Highlands. The\\nironbound prisoner refers to Lochiel.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIV. ON HAPPINESS OF TEMPER. (215)\\n\\nOliver Goldsmith, 1728-1774. This eccentric son of genius was an Irishman;\\nhis father was a poor curate. Goldsmith received his education at several\\npreparatory schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at\\nLeyden. He was indolent and unruly as a student, often in disgrace with\\nhis teachers; but his generosity, recklessness, and love of athletic\\nsports made him a favorite with his fellow-students. He spent some time in\\nwandering over the continent, often in poverty and want. In 1756 he\\nreturned to England, and soon took up his abode in London. Here he made\\nthe acquaintance and friendship of several notable men, among whom were\\nJohnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. \"The Traveler\" was published in 1764, and\\nwas soon followed by the \"Vicar of Wakefield.\" He wrote in nearly all\\ndepartments of literature, and always with purity, grace, and fluency. His\\nfame as a poet is secured by the \"Traveler\" and the \"Deserted Village;\" as\\na dramatist, by \"She Stoops to Conquer;\" as a satirist, by the \"Citizen of\\nthe World;\" and as a novelist by the \"Vicar of Wakefield.\" In his later\\nyears his writings were the source of a large income, but his gambling,\\ncareless generosity, and reckless extravagance always kept him in\\nfinancial difficulty, and he died heavily in debt. His monument is in\\nWestminster Abbey.\\n##\\n\\n\\nWriters of every age have endeavored to show that pleasure is in us, and\\nnot in the objects offered for our amusement. If the soul be happily\\ndisposed, everything becomes capable of affording entertainment, and\\ndistress will almost want a name. Every occurrence passes in review, like\\nthe figures of a procession; some may be awkward, others ill-dressed, but\\nnone but a fool is on that account enraged with the master of ceremonies.\\n\\nI remember to have once seen a slave, in a fortification in Flanders, who\\nappeared no way touched with his situation. He was maimed, deformed, and\\nchained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall, and\\ncondemned to this for life; yet, with all these circumstances of apparent\\nwretchedness, he sang, would have danced, but that he wanted a leg, and\\nappeared the merriest, happiest man of all the garrison. What a practical\\nphilosopher was here! A happy constitution supplied philosophy, and though\\nseemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise. No reading or study had\\ncontributed to disenchant the fairyland around him. Everything furnished\\nhim with an opportunity of mirth; and though some thought him, from his\\ninsensibility, a fool, he was such an idiot as philosophers should wish to\\nimitate.\\n\\nThey who, like that slave, can place themselves all that side of the world\\nin which everything appears in a pleasant light, will find something in\\nevery occurrence to excite their good humor. The most calamitous events,\\neither to themselves or others, can bring no new affliction; the world is\\nto them a theater, in which only comedies are acted. All the bustle of\\nheroism, or the aspirations of ambition, seem only to heighten the\\nabsurdity of the scene, and make the humor more poignant. They feel, in\\nshort, as little anguish at their own distress, or the complaints of\\nothers, as the undertaker, though dressed in black, feels sorrow at a\\nfuneral. Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal de Retz\\npossessed this happiness in the highest degree. When fortune wore her\\nangriest look, and he fell into the power of Cardinal Mazarin, his most\\ndeadly enemy, (being confined a close prisoner in the castle of\\nValenciennes,) he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or\\nphilosophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at himself\\' and\\nhis persecutor, and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation. In\\nthis mansion of distress, though denied all amusements, and even the\\nconveniences of life, and entirely cut off from all intercourse with his\\nfriends, he still retained his good humor, laughed at the little spite of\\nhis enemies, and carried the jest so far as to write the life of his\\njailer.\\n\\nAll that the wisdom of the proud can teach, is to be stubborn or sullen\\nunder misfortunes. The Cardinal\\'s example will teach us to be good-\\nhumored in circumstances of the highest affliction. It matters not whether\\nour good humor be construed by others into insensibility or idiotism,--it\\nis happiness to ourselves; and none but a fool could measure his\\nsatisfaction by what the world thinks of it.\\n\\nThe happiest fellow I ever knew, was of the number of those good-natured\\ncreatures that are said to do no harm to anybody but themselves. Whenever\\nhe fell into any misery, he called it \"seeing life,\" If his head was\\nbroken by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a sharper, he comforted\\nhimself by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more\\nfashionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiss to him. His inattention\\nto money matters had concerned his father to such a degree that all\\nintercession of friends was fruitless. The old gentleman was on his\\ndeathbed. The whole family (and Dick among the number) gathered around\\nhim.\\n\\n\"I leave my second son, Andrew,\" said the expiring miser, \"my whole\\nestate, and desire him to be frugal.\" Andrew, in a sorrowful tone (as is\\nusual on such occasions), prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to\\nenjoy it himself. \"I recommend Simon, my third son, to the care of his\\nelder brother, and leave him, besides, four thousand pounds.\" \"Ah,\\nfather!\" cried Simon (in great affliction, to be sure), \"may heaven give\\nyou life and health to enjoy it yourself!\" At last, turning to poor Dick:\\n\"As for you, you have always been a sad dog; you\\'ll never come to good;\\nyou\\'ll never be rich; I leave you a shilling to buy a halter.\" \"Ah,\\nfather!\" cries Dick, without any emotion, \"may heaven give you life and\\nhealth to enjoy it yourself!\"\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Cardinal de Retz, Jean Francois Paul de Gondi (b. 1614, d. 1679),\\nwas leader of the revolt against Jules Mazarin (b. 1602, d. 1661), the\\nprime minister of France during the minority of Louis XIV. This led to a\\nwar which lasted four or five years. After peace had been concluded, and\\nLouis XIV. established on the throne, Mazarin was reinstated in power, and\\nCardinal de Retz was imprisoned.\\n\\nFlanders, formerly part of the Netherlands, is now included in Belgium,\\nHolland and France.\\n\\n\\n\\nLV. THE FORTUNE TELLER. (218)\\n\\nHenry Mackenzie, 1745-1831, was born in Edinburgh, educated at the\\nuniversity there, and died in the same city. He was an attorney by\\nprofession, and was the associate of many famous literary men residing at\\nthat time in Edinburgh. His fame as a writer rests chiefly on two novels,\\n\"The Man of Feeling\" and \"The Man of the World;\" both were published\\nbefore the author was forty years old.\\n###\\n\\n\\nHarley sat down on a large stone by the wayside, to take a pebble from his\\nshoe, when he saw, at some distance, a beggar approaching him. He had on a\\nloose sort of coat, mended with different-colored rags, among which the\\nblue and russet were predominant. He had a short, knotty stick in his\\nhand, and on the top of it was stuck a ram\\'s horn; he wore no shoes, and\\nhis stockings had entirely lost that part of them which would have covered\\nhis feet and ankles; in his face, however, was the plump appearance of\\ngood humor; he walked a good, round pace, and a crook-legged dog trotted\\nat his heels.\\n\\n\"Our delicacies,\" said Harley to himself, \"are fantastic; they are not in\\nnature! That beggar walks over the sharpest of these stones barefooted,\\nwhilst I have lost the most delightful dream in the world from the\\nsmallest of them happening to get into my shoe.\" The beggar had by this\\ntime come up, and, pulling off a piece of a hat, asked charity of Harley.\\nThe dog began to beg, too. It was impossible to resist both; and, in\\ntruth, the want of shoes and stockings had made both unnecessary, for\\nHarley had destined sixpence for him before.\\n\\nThe beggar, on receiving it, poured forth blessings without number; and,\\nwith a sort of smile on his countenance, said to Harley that if he wanted\\nto have his fortune told--Harley turned his eye briskly upon the beggar;\\nit was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction, and silenced\\nthe prophet immediately. \"I would much rather learn\" said Harley, \"what it\\nis in your power to tell me. Your trade must be an entertaining one; sit\\ndown on this stone, and let me know something of your profession; I have\\noften thought of turning fortune teller for a week or two, myself.\"\\n\\n\"Master,\" replied the beggar, \"I like your frankness much, for I had the\\nhumor of plain dealing in me from a child; but there is no doing with it\\nin this world,--we must do as we can; and lying is, as you call it, my\\nprofession. But I was in some sort forced to the trade, for I once dealt\\nin telling the truth. I was a laborer, sir, and gained as much as to make\\nme live. I never laid by, indeed, for I was reckoned a piece of a wag, and\\nyour wags, I take it, are seldom rich, Mr. Harley.\" \"So,\" said Harley,\\n\"you seem to know me.\" \"Ay, there are few folks in the country that I do\\nn\\'t know something of. How should I tell fortunes else?\" \"True,--but go on\\nwith your story; you were a laborer, you say, and a wag; your industry, I\\nsuppose, you left with your old trade; but your humor you preserved to be\\nof use to you in your new.\"\\n\\n\"What signifies sadness, sir? A man grows lean on \\'t. But I was brought to\\nmy idleness by degrees; sickness first disabled me, and it went against my\\nstomach to work, ever after. But, in truth, I was for a long time so weak\\nthat I spit blood whenever I attempted to work. I had no relation living,\\nand I never kept a friend above a week when I was able to joke. Thus I was\\nforced to beg my bread, and a sorry trade I have found it, Mr. Harley. I\\ntold all my misfortunes truly, but they were seldom believed; and the few\\nwho gave me a half-penny as they passed, did it with a shake of the head,\\nand an injunction not to trouble them with a long story. In short, I found\\nthat people do n\\'t care to give alms without some security for their\\nmoney,--such as a wooden leg, or a withered arm, for example. So I changed\\nmy plan, and instead of telling my own misfortunes, began to prophesy\\nhappiness to others.\\n\\n\"This I found by much the better way. Folks will always listen when the\\ntale is their own, and of many who say they do not believe in fortune\\ntelling, I have known few on whom it had not a very sensible effect. I\\npick up the names of their acquaintance; amours and little squabbles are\\neasily gleaned from among servants and neighbors; and, indeed, people\\nthemselves are the best intelligencers in the world for our purpose. They\\ndare not puzzle us for their own sakes, for everyone is anxious to hear\\nwhat he wishes to believe; and they who repeat it, to laugh at it when\\nthey have done, are generally more serious than their hearers are apt to\\nimagine. With a tolerably good memory, and some share of cunning, I\\nsucceed reasonably well as a fortune teller. With this, and showing the\\ntricks of that dog, I make shift to pick up a livelihood.\\n\\n\"My trade is none of the most honest, yet people are not much cheated\\nafter all, who give a few half-pence for a prospect of happiness, which I\\nhave heard some persons say, is all a man can arrive at in this world.

RIENZI\\'S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS. (221)\\n\\nMary Russell Mitford, 1786-1855. She was the daughter of a physician, and\\nwas born in Hampshire, England. At twenty years of age, she published\\nthree volumes of poems; and soon after entered upon literature as a\\nlifelong occupation. She wrote tales, sketches, poems, and dramas. \"Our\\nVillage\" is the best known of her prose works; the book describes the\\ndaily life of a rural people, is simple but finished in style, and is\\nmarked by mingled humor and pathos. Her most noted drama is \"Rienzi.\" Miss\\nMitford passed the last forty years of her life in a little cottage in\\nBerkshire, among a simple, country people, to whom she was greatly\\nendeared by her kindness and social virtues.\\n###\\n\\n\\nI come not here to talk. You know too well\\nThe story of our thraldom. We are slaves!\\nThe bright sun rises to his course, and lights\\nA race of slaves! He sets, and his last beams\\nFall on a slave; not such as, swept along\\nBy the full tide of power, the conqueror led\\nTo crimson glory and undying fame;\\nBut base, ignoble slaves; slaves to a horde\\nOf petty tyrants, feudal despots, lords,\\nRich in some dozen paltry villages;\\nStrong in some hundred spearmen; only great\\nIn that strange spell,--a name.\\n\\n              Each hour, dark fraud,\\nOr open rapine, or protected murder,\\nCries out against them. But this very day,\\nAn honest man, my neighbor,--there he stands,--\\nWas struck--struck like a dog, by one who wore\\nThe badge of Ursini; because, forsooth,\\nHe tossed not high his ready cap in air,\\nNor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,\\nAt sight of that great ruffian! Be we men,\\nAnd suffer such dishonor? men, and wash not\\nThe stain away in blood? Such shames are common.\\nI have known deeper wrongs; I that speak to ye,\\nI had a brother once--a gracious boy,\\nFull of all gentleness, of calmest hope,\\nOf sweet and quiet joy,--there was the look\\nOf heaven upon his face, which limners give\\nTo the beloved disciple.\\n\\n                                How I loved\\nThat gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years,\\nBrother at once, and son! He left my side,\\nA summer bloom on his fair cheek; a smile\\nParting his innocent lips. In one short hour,\\nThat pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw\\nThe corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried\\nFor vengeance! Rouse, ye Romans! rouse, ye slaves!\\nHave ye brave sons? Look in the next fierce brawl\\nTo see them die. Have ye fair daughters? Look\\nTo see them live, torn from your arms, distained,\\nDishonored; and if ye dare call for justice,\\nBe answered by the lash.\\n\\n                               Yet this is Rome,\\nThat sat on her seven hills, and from her throne\\nOf beauty ruled the world! and we are Romans.\\nWhy, in that elder day, to be a Roman\\nWas greater than a king!\\n\\n                         And once again,--\\nHear me, ye walls that echoed to the tread\\nOf either Brutus! Once again, I swear,\\nThe eternal city shall be free.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Rienzi (b. about 1312, d. 1354) was the last of the Roman\\ntribunes. In 1347 he led a successful revolt against the nobles, who by\\ntheir contentions kept Rome in constant turmoil. He then assumed the title\\nof tribune, but, after indulging in a life of reckless extravagance and\\npomp for a few months, he was compelled to abdicate, and fly for his life.\\nIn 1354 he was reinstated in power, but his tyranny caused his\\nassassination the same year.\\n\\nThe Ursini wore one of the noble families of Rome.\\n\\nThis lesson is especially adapted for drill on inflection, emphasis, and\\nmodulation.\\n\\n\\n\\nLVll. CHARACTER OF THE PURITAN FATHERS OF NEW ENGLAND. (223)\\n\\nOne of the most prominent features which distinguished our forefathers,\\nwas their determined resistance to oppression. They seemed born and\\nbrought up for the high and special purpose of showing to the world that\\nthe civil and religious rights of man--the rights of self-government, of\\nconscience, and independent thought--are not merely things to be talked of\\nand woven into theories, but to be adopted with the whole strength and\\nardor of the mind, and felt in the profoundest recesses of the heart, and\\ncarried out into the general life, and made the foundation of practical\\nusefulness, and visible beauty, and true nobility.\\n\\nLiberty, with them, was an object of too serious desire and stern resolve\\nto be personified, allegorized, and enshrined. They made no goddess of it,\\nas the ancients did; they had no time nor inclination for such trifling;\\nthey felt that liberty was the simple birthright of every human creature;\\nthey called it so; they claimed it as such; they reverenced and held it\\nfast as the unalienable gift of the Creator, which was not to be\\nsurrendered to power, nor sold for wages.\\n\\nIt was theirs, as men; without it, they did not esteem themselves men;\\nmore than any other privilege or possession, it was essential to their\\nhappiness, for it was essential to their original nature; and therefore\\nthey preferred it above wealth, and ease, and country; and, that they\\nmight enjoy and exercise it fully, they forsook houses, and lands, and\\nkindred, their homes, their native soil, and their fathers\\' graves.\\n\\nThey left all these; they left England, which, whatever it might have been\\ncalled, was not to them a land of freedom; they launched forth on the\\npathless ocean, the wide, fathomless ocean, soiled not by the earth\\nbeneath, and bounded, all round and above, only by heaven; and it seemed\\nto them like that better and sublimer freedom, which their country knew\\nnot, but of which they had the conception and image in their hearts; and,\\nafter a toilsome and painful voyage, they came to a hard and wintry coast,\\nunfruitful and desolate, but unguarded and boundless; its calm silence\\ninterrupted not the ascent of their prayers; it had no eyes to watch, no\\nears to hearken, no tongues to report of them; here, again, there was an\\nanswer to their soul\\'s desire, and they were satisfied, and gave thanks;\\nthey saw that they were free, and the desert smiled.\\n\\nI am telling an old tale; but it is one which must be told when we speak\\nof those men. It is to be added, that they transmitted their principles to\\ntheir children, and that, peopled by such a race, our country was always\\nfree. So long as its inhabitants were unmolested by the mother country in\\nthe exercise of their important rights, they submitted to the form of\\nEnglish government; but when those rights were invaded, they spurned even\\nthe form away.\\n\\nThis act was the Revolution, which came of course and spontaneously, and\\nhad nothing in it of the wonderful or unforeseen. The wonder would have\\nbeen if it had not occurred. It was, indeed, a happy and glorious event,\\nbut by no means unnatural; and I intend no slight to the revered actors in\\nthe Revolution when I assert that their fathers before them were as free\\nas they--every whit as free.\\n\\nThe principles of the Revolution were not the suddenly acquired property\\nof a few bosoms: they were abroad in the land in the ages before; they had\\nalways been taught, like the truths of the Bible; they had descended from\\nfather to son, down from those primitive days, when the Pilgrim,\\nestablished in his simple dwelling, and seated at his blazing fire, piled\\nhigh from the forest which shaded his door, repeated to his listening\\nchildren the story of his wrongs and his resistance, and bade them\\nrejoice, though the wild winds and the wild beasts were howling without,\\nthat they had nothing to fear from great men\\'s oppression.\\n\\nHere are the beginnings of the Revolution. Every settler\\'s hearth was a\\nschool of independence; the scholars were apt, and the lessons sunk\\ndeeply; and thus it came that our country was always free; it could not be\\nother than free.\\n\\nAs deeply seated as was the principle of liberty and resistance to\\narbitrary power in the breasts of the Puritans, it was not more so than\\ntheir piety and sense of religious obligation. They were emphatically a\\npeople whose God was the Lord. Their form of government was as strictly\\ntheocratical, if direct communication be excepted, as was that of the\\nJews; insomuch that it would be difficult to say where there was any civil\\nauthority among them entirely distinct from ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\\n\\nWhenever a few of them settled a town, they immediately gathered\\nthemselves into a church; and their elders were magistrates, and their\\ncode of laws was the Pentateuch. These were forms, it is true, but forms\\nwhich faithfully indicated principles and feelings; for no people could\\nhave adopted such forms, who were not thoroughly imbued with the spirit,\\nand bent on the practice, of religion.\\n\\nGod was their King; and they regarded him as truly and literally so, as if\\nhe had dwelt in a visible palace in the midst of their state. They were\\nhis devoted, resolute, humble subjects; they undertook nothing which they\\ndid not beg of him to prosper; they accomplished nothing without rendering\\nto him the praise; they suffered nothing without carrying their sorrows to\\nhis throne; they ate nothing which they did not implore him to bless.\\n\\nTheir piety was not merely external; it was sincere; it had the proof of a\\ngood tree in bearing good fruit; it produced and sustained a strict\\nmorality. Their tenacious purity of manners and speech obtained for them,\\nin the mother country, their name of Puritans, which, though given in\\nderision, was as honorable an appellation as was ever bestowed by man on\\nman.\\n\\nThat there were hypocrites among them, is not to be doubted; but they were\\nrare. The men who voluntarily exiled themselves to an unknown coast, and\\nendured there every toil and hardship for conscience\\' sake, and that they\\nmight serve God in their own manner, were not likely to set conscience at\\ndefiance, and make the service of God a mockery; they were not likely to\\nbe, neither were they, hypocrites. I do not know that it would be\\narrogating too much for them to say, that, on the extended surface of the\\nglobe, there was not a single community of men to be compared with them,\\nin the respects of deep religious impressions and an exact performance of\\nmoral duty.\\n                                                      F. W. P. Greenwood.\\n\\nNOTE.--The Pentateuch is the first five books of the Old Testament. The\\nword is derived from two Greek words, (pente), five, and (tenchos), book.\\n\\n\\n\\nLVIII. LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS. (226)\\n\\nFelicia Dorothea Hemans, 1794-1835, was born in Liverpool. Her father,\\nwhose name was Browne, was an Irish merchant. She spent her childhood in\\nWales, began to write poetry at a very early age, and was married when\\nabout eighteen to Captain Hemans. By this marriage, she became the mother\\nof five sons; but, owing to differences of taste and disposition, her\\nhusband left her at the end of six years; and by mutual agreement they\\nnever again lived together. Mrs. Hemans now made literature a profession,\\nand wrote much and well. In 1826 Prof. Andrews Norton brought out an\\nedition of her poems in America, where they became popular, and have\\nremained so.\\n\\nMrs. Hemans\\'s poetry is smooth and graceful, frequently tinged with a\\nshade of melancholy, but never despairing, cynical, or misanthropic. It\\nnever deals with the highest themes, nor rises to sublimity, but its\\ninfluence is calculated to make the reader truer, nobler, and purer.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe breaking waves dashed high\\n  On a stern and rock-bound coast,\\nAnd the woods against a stormy sky\\n  Their giant branches tossed;\\n\\nAnd the heavy night hung dark,\\n  The hills and waters o\\'er,\\nWhen a band of exiles moored their bark\\n  On the wild New England shore.\\n\\nNot as the conqueror comes,\\n  They, the true-hearted, came;\\nNot with the roll of the stirring drums.\\n  And the trumpet that sings of fame.\\n\\nNot as the flying come,\\n  In silence, and in fear;--\\nThey shook the depths of the desert gloom\\n  With their hymns of lofty cheer.\\n\\nAmidst the storm they sang,\\n  And the stars heard, and the sea;\\nAnd the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang\\n  To the anthem of the free!\\n\\nThe ocean eagle soared\\n  From his nest by the white wave\\'s foam;\\nAnd the rocking pines of the forest roared,--\\n  This was their welcome home.\\n\\nThere were men with hoary hair\\n  Amidst that pilgrim band:\\nWhy had they come to wither there,\\n  Away from their childhood\\'s land?\\n\\nThere was woman\\'s fearless eye,\\n  Lit by her deep love\\'s truth;\\nThere was manhood\\'s brow, serenely high,\\n  And the fiery heart of youth.\\n\\nWhat sought they thus afar?\\n  Bright jewels of the mine?\\nThe wealth of seas, the spoils of war?\\n  They sought a faith\\'s pure shrine!\\n\\nAy, call it holy ground,\\n  The soil where first they trod:\\nThey have left unstained what there they found,--\\n  Freedom to worship God.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth, Mass, Dec. 11th (Old\\nStyle), 1620. The rock on which they first stepped, is in Water Street of\\nthe village, and is covered by a handsome granite canopy, surmounted by a\\ncolossal statue of Faith.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIX. NECESSITY OF EDUCATION. (228)\\n\\nWe must educate! We must educate! or we must perish by our own prosperity.\\nIf we do not, short will be our race from the cradle to the grave. If, in\\nour haste to be rich and mighty, we outrun our literary and religious\\ninstitutions, they will never overtake us; or only come up after the\\nbattle of liberty is fought and lost, as spoils to grace the victory, and\\nas resources of inexorable despotism for the perpetuity of our bondage.\\n\\nBut what will become of the West if her prosperity rushes up to such a\\nmajesty of power, while those great institutions linger which are\\nnecessary to form the mind, and the conscience, and the heart of the vast\\nworld? It must not be permitted. And yet what is done must be done\\nquickly; for population will not wait, and commerce will not cast anchor,\\nand manufactures will not shut off the steam, nor shut down the gate, and\\nagriculture, pushed by millions of freemen on their fertile soil, will not\\nwithhold her corrupting abundance.\\n\\nAnd let no man at the East quiet himself, and dream of liberty, whatever\\nmay become of the West. Our alliance of blood, and political institutions,\\nand common interests, is such, that we can not stand aloof in the hour of\\nher calamity, should it ever come. Her destiny is our destiny; and the day\\nthat her gallant ship goes down, our little boat sinks in the vortex!\\n\\nThe great experiment is now making, and from its extent and rapid filling\\nup, is making in the West, whether the perpetuity of our republican\\ninstitutions can be reconciled with universal suffrage. Without the\\neducation of the head and heart of the nation, they can not be; and the\\nquestion to be decided is, can the nation, or the vast balance power of\\nit, be so imbued with intelligence and virtue as to bring out, in laws and\\ntheir administration, a perpetual self-preserving energy. We know that the\\nwork is a vast one, and of great difficulty; and yet we believe it can be\\ndone.\\n\\nI am aware that our ablest patriots are looking out on the deep, vexed\\nwith storms, with great forebodings and failings of heart, for fear of the\\nthings that are coming upon us; and I perceive a spirit of impatience\\nrising, and distrust in respect to the perpetuity of our republic; and I\\nam sure that these fears are well founded, and am glad that they exist. It\\nis the star of hope in our dark horizon. Fear is what we need, as the ship\\nneeds wind on a rocking sea, after a storm, to prevent foundering. But\\nwhen our fear and our efforts shall correspond with our danger, the danger\\nis past.\\n\\nFor it is not the impossibility of self-preservation which threatens us;\\nnor is it the unwillingness of the nation to pay the price of the\\npreservation, as she has paid the price of the purchase of our liberties.\\nIt is inattention and inconsideration, protracted till the crisis is past,\\nand the things which belong to our peace are hid from our eyes. And\\nblessed be God, that the tokens of a national waking up, the harbinger of\\nGod\\'s mercy, are multiplying upon us!\\n\\nWe did not, in the darkest hour, believe that God had brought our fathers\\nto this goodly land to lay the foundation of religious liberty, and\\nwrought such wonders in their preservation, and raised their descendants\\nto such heights of civil and religious liberty, only to reverse the\\nanalogy of his providence, and abandon his work.\\n\\nAnd though there now be clouds, and the sea roaring, and men\\'s hearts\\nfailing, we believe there is light behind the cloud, and that the\\nimminence of our danger is intended, under the guidance of Heaven, to call\\nforth and apply a holy, fraternal fellowship between the East and the\\nWest, which shall secure our preservation, and make the prosperity of our\\nnation durable as time, and as abundant as the waves of the sea.\\n\\nI would add, as a motive to immediate action, that if we do fail in our\\ngreat experiment of self-government, our destruction will be as signal as\\nthe birthright abandoned, the mercies abused, and the provocation offered\\nto beneficent Heaven. The descent of desolation will correspond with the\\npast elevation.\\n\\nNo punishments of Heaven are so severe as those for mercies abused; and no\\ninstrumentality employed in their infliction is so dreadful as the wrath\\nof man. No spasms are like the spasms of expiring liberty, and no wailing\\nsuch as her convulsions extort.\\n\\nIt took Rome three hundred years to die; and our death, if we perish, will\\nbe as much more terrific as our intelligence and free institutions have\\ngiven us more bone, sinew, and vitality. May God hide from me the day when\\nthe dying agonies of my country shall begin! O thou beloved land, bound\\ntogether by the ties of brotherhood, and common interest, and perils! live\\nforever--one and undivided!\\n                                                          --Lyman Beecher.\\n\\n\\n\\nLX. RIDING ON A SNOWPLOW. (231)\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin Taylor, 1822-1887, was born at Lowville, New York, and\\ngraduated at Madison University, of which his father was president. Here\\nhe remained as resident graduate for about five years. His \"Attractions of\\nLanguage\" was published in 1845. For many years Mr. Taylor was literary\\neditor of the \"Chicago Journal.\" He wrote considerably for the magazines,\\nand was the author of many well-known fugitive pieces, both in prose and\\nverse. He also published several books, of which \"January and June,\"\\n\"Pictures in Camp and Field,\" \"The World on Wheels,\" \"Old-time Pictures\\nand Sheaves of Rhyme,\" \"Between the Gates,\" and \"Songs of Yesterday,\" are\\nthe best known. In his later years, Mr. Taylor achieved some reputation as\\na lecturer. His writings are marked by an exuberant fancy.\\n###\\n\\n\\nDid you ever ride on a snowplow? Not the pet and pony of a thing that is\\nattached to the front of an engine, sometimes, like a pilot; but a great\\ntwo-storied monster of strong timbers, that runs upon wheels of its own,\\nand that boys run after and stare at as they would after and at an\\nelephant. You are snow-bound at Buffalo. The Lake Shore Line is piled with\\ndrifts like a surf. Two passenger trains have been half-buried for twelve\\nhours somewhere in snowy Chautauqua. The storm howls like a congregation\\nof Arctic bears. But the superintendent at Buffalo is determined to\\nrelease his castaways, and clear the road to Erie. He permits you to be a\\npassenger on the great snowplow; and there it is, all ready to drive.\\nHarnessed behind it, is a tandem team of three engines. It does not occur\\nto you that you are going to ride on a steam drill, and so you get aboard.\\n\\n\\nIt is a spacious and timbered room, with one large bull\\'s eye window,--an\\novergrown lens. The thing is a sort of Cyclops. There are ropes, and\\nchains, and a windlass. There is a bell by which the engineer of the first\\nengine can signal the plowman, and a cord whereby the plowman can talk\\nback. There are two sweeps, or arms, worked by machinery, on the sides.\\nYou ask their use, and the superintendent replies, \"When, in a violent\\nshock, there is danger of the monster\\'s upsetting, an arm is put out, on\\none side or the other, to keep the thing from turning a complete\\nsomersault.\" You get one idea, and an inkling of another. So you take out\\nyour Accident Policy for three thousand dollars, and examine it. It never\\nmentions battles, nor duels, nor snowplows. It names \"public conveyances.\"\\nIs a snowplow a public conveyance? You are inclined to think it is neither\\nthat nor any other kind that you should trust yourself to, but it is too\\nlate for consideration.\\n\\nYou roll out of Buffalo in the teeth of the wind, and the world is turned\\nto snow. All goes merrily. The machine strikes little drifts, and they\\nscurry away in a cloud. The three engines breathe easily; but by and by\\nthe earth seems broken into great billows of dazzling white. The sun comes\\nout of a cloud, and touches it up till it out-silvers Potosi. Houses lie\\nin the trough of the sea everywhere, and it requires little imagination to\\nthink they are pitching and tossing before your eyes. A great breaker\\nrises right in the way. The monster, with you in it, works its way up and\\nfeels of it. It is packed like a ledge of marble. Three whistles! The\\nmachine backs away and keeps backing, as a gymnast runs astern to get sea\\nroom and momentum for a big jump; as a giant swings aloft a heavy sledge,\\nthat it may come down with a heavy blow.\\n\\nOne whistle! You have come to a halt. Three pairs of whistles one after\\nthe other! and then, putting on all steam, you make for the drift. The\\nsuperintendent locks the door, you do not quite understand why, and in a\\nsecond the battle begins. The machine rocks and creaks in all its joints.\\nThere comes a tremendous shock. The cabin is as dark as midnight. The\\nclouds of flying snow put out the day. The labored breathing of the\\nlocomotives behind you, the clouds of smoke and steam that wrap you up as\\nin a mantle, the noonday eclipse of the sun, the surging of the ship, the\\nrattling of chains, the creak of timbers as if the craft were aground and\\nthe sea getting out of its bed to whelm you altogether, the doubt as to\\nwhat will come,--all combine to make a scene of strange excitement for a\\nlandlubber.\\n\\nYou have made some impression on the breaker, and again the machine backs\\nfor a fair start, and then another plunge, and shock, and twilight. And\\nso, from deep cut to deep cut, as if the season had packed all his winter\\nclothes upon the track, until the stalled trains are reached and passed;\\nand then, with alternate storm and calm, and halt and shock, till the way\\nis cleared to Erie.\\n\\nIt is Sunday afternoon, and Erie--\"Mad Anthony Wayne\\'s\" old\\nheadquarters--has donned its Sunday clothes, and turned out by hundreds to\\nsee the great plow come in,--its first voyage over the line. The\\nlocomotives set up a crazy scream, and you draw slowly into the depot. The\\ndoor opened at last, you clamber down, and gaze up at the uneasy house in\\nwhich you have been living. It looks as if an avalanche had tumbled down\\nupon it,--white as an Alpine shoulder. Your first thought is gratitude\\nthat you have made a landing alive. Your second, a resolution that, if\\nagain you ride a hammer, it will not be when three engines have hold of\\nthe handle!\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Chautauqua is the most western county in the state of New York; it\\nborders on Lake Erie.\\n\\nThe Cyclops are described in Grecian mythology as giants having only one\\neye, which was circular, and placed in the middle of the forehead.\\n\\nCerro de Potosi is a mountain in Bolivia, South America, celebrated for\\nits mineral wealth. More than five thousand mines have been opened in it;\\nthe product is chiefly silver.\\n\\n\"Mad Anthony Wayne\" (b. 1745, d. 1796), so called from his bravery and\\napparent recklessness, was a famous American officer during the\\nRevolution. In 1794 be conducted a successful campaign against the Indians\\nof the Northwest, making his headquarters at Erie, Pa.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXI. THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS. (234)\\n\\nCas. That you have wronged me doth appear in this:\\n     You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella\\n     For taking bribes here of the Sardians;\\n     Wherein my letters, praying on his side,\\n     Because I knew the man, were slighted off.\\n     Bru. You wronged yourself to write in such a case.\\nCas. In such a time as this, it is not meet\\n     That every nice offense should bear his comment.\\nBru. Yet let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself\\n     Are much condemned to have an itching palm,\\n     To sell and mart your offices for gold\\n     To undeservers.\\nCas.                  I an itching palm!\\n     You know that you are Brutus that speak this,\\n     Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\\nBru. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,\\n     And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.\\nCas. Chastisement!\\nBru. Remember March, the ides of March remember!\\n     Did not great Julius bleed for justice\\' sake?\\n     What villain touched his body, that did stab,\\n     And not for justice? What! shall one of us,\\n     That struck the foremost man of all this world\\n     But for supporting robbers; shall we now\\n     Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,\\n     And sell the mighty space of our large honors\\n     For so much trash as may be graspe\\'d thus?\\n     I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\\n     Than such a Roman.\\nCas.                   Brutus, bay not me;\\n     I\\'ll not endure it: you forget yourself,\\n     To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,\\n     Older in practice, abler than yourself\\n     To make conditions.\\nBru.                    Go to; you are not, Cassius.\\nCas. I am.\\nBru. I say you are not.\\nCas. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself:\\n     Have mind upon your health; tempt me no further.\\nBru. Away, slight man!\\nCas. Is\\'t possible?\\nBru.                Hear me, for I will speak.\\n     Must I give way and room to your rash choler?\\n     Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?\\nCas. O ye gods! ye gods! must I endure all this?\\nBru. All this! Ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;\\n     Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,\\n     And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?\\n     Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch\\n     Under your testy humor? By the gods,\\n     You shall digest the venom of your spleen,\\n     Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,\\n     I\\'ll use you for my mirth, yea for my laughter,\\n     When you are waspish.\\nCas.                      Is it come to this?\\nBru. You say you are a better soldier;\\n     Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,\\n     And it shall please me well: for mine own part,\\n     I shall be glad to learn of noble men.\\nCas. You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;\\n     I said, an elder soldier, not a better:\\n     Did I say \"better\"?\\nBru.                     If you did, I care not.\\nCas. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.\\nBru. Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.\\nCas. I durst not?\\nBru. No.\\nCas. What! durst not tempt him?\\nBru.                            For your life, you durst not.\\nCas. Do not presume too much upon my love;\\n     I may do that I shall be sorry for.\\nBru. You have done that you should be sorry for.\\n     There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;\\n     For I am armed so strong in honesty\\n     That they pass by me as the idle wind,\\n     Which I respect not. I did send to you\\n     For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;--\\n     For I can raise no money by vile means:\\n     By heaven! I had rather coin my heart,\\n     And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring\\n     From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\\n     By any indirection.--I did send\\n     To you for gold to pay my legions,\\n     Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?\\n     Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?\\n     When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,\\n     To lock such rascal counters from his friends,\\n     Be ready, gods, with an your thunderbolts;\\n     Dash him to pieces!\\nCas.

(242)\\n\\nThe appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty fowling\\npiece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and children at his heels,\\nsoon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They crowded\\naround him, eying him from head to foot with great curiosity. The orator\\nbustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired on which side\\nhe voted. Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little\\nfellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe, inquired in his ear\\n\"whether he was Federal or Democrat.\"\\n\\nRip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing,\\nself-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through\\nthe crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he\\npassed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the\\nother resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat, penetrating, as it\\nwere, into his very soul, demanded, in an austere tone, what brought him\\nto the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his heels, and\\nwhether he meant to breed a riot in the village.\\n\\n\"Alas! gentlemen,\" cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, \"I am a poor, quiet man,\\na native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless him!\"\\nHere a general shout burst from the bystanders.--\"A tory! a tory! a spy! a\\nrefugee! hustle him! away with him!\" It was with great difficulty that the\\nself-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and, having a tenfold\\nausterity of brow, demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came\\nthere for, and whom he was seeking. The poor man humbly assured him that\\nhe meant no harm, but merely came there in search of some of his\\nneighbors, who used to keep about the tavern. \"Well, who are they? name\\nthem.\"\\n\\nRip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, \"Where\\'s Nicholas Vedder?\"\\nThere was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in a\\nthin, piping voice, \"Nicholas Vedder! why he is dead and gone these\\neighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used\\nto tell all about him, but that\\'s rotten and gone too.\" \"Where\\'s Brom\\nDutcher?\" \"Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war. Some\\nsay he was killed at the storming of Stony Point; others say he was\\ndrowned in a squall at the foot of Anthony\\'s Nose. I don\\'t know; he never\\ncame back again.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?\" \"He went off to the wars,  too;\\nwas a great militia general, and is now in Congress.\" Rip\\'s heart died\\naway at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends, and finding\\nhimself thus alone in the world. Every answer puzzled him, too, by\\ntreating of such enormous lapses of time, and of matters which he could\\nnot understand--war, Congress, Stony Point. He had no courage to ask after\\nany more friends, but cried out in despair, \"Does nobody here know Rip Van\\nWinkle?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Rip Van Winkle!\" exclaimed two or three. \"Oh, to be sure! That\\'s Rip\\nVan Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.\" Rip looked, and beheld a\\nprecise counterpart of himself as he went up the mountain; apparently as\\nlazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely\\nconfounded; he doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or\\nanother man. In the midst of his bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat\\ndemanded who he was, and what was his name.\\n\\n\"God knows!\" exclaimed he, at his wit\\'s end. \"I\\'m not myself; I\\'m somebody\\nelse; that\\'s me yonder; no, that\\'s somebody else got into my shoes. I was\\nmyself last night; but I fell asleep on the mountain, and they\\'ve changed\\nmy gun, and everything\\'s changed, and I\\'m changed, and I can\\'t tell what\\'s\\nmy name or who I am!\"\\n\\nThe bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink significantly,\\nand tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was a whisper, also,\\nabout securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief, at\\nthe very suggestion of which the self-important man in the cocked hat\\nretired with some precipitation. At this critical moment, a fresh, comely\\nwoman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man.\\nShe had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began\\nto cry. \"Hush, Rip!\" cried she, \"hush, you little fool! the old man won\\'t\\nhurt you.\"\\n\\nThe name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all\\nawakened a train of recollections in his mind. \"What is your name, my good\\nwoman?\" asked he. \"Judith Gardenier.\" \"And your father\\'s name?\" \"Ah, poor\\nman! Rip Van Winkle was his name; but it\\'s twenty years since he went away\\nfrom home with his gun, and never has been heard of since; his dog came\\nhome without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the\\nIndians, nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl.\"\\n\\nRip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering\\nvoice: \"Where\\'s your mother?\" \"Oh, she, too, died but a short time since;\\nshe broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a New England peddler.\"\\nThere was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest\\nman could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and her child\\nin his arms. \"I am your father!\" cried he. \"Young Rip Van Winkle once, old\\nRip Van Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?\"\\n\\nAll stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd,\\nput her hand to her brow, and, peering under it in his face for a moment,\\nexclaimed, \"Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle! it is himself! Welcome home\\nagain, old neighbor! Why, where have you been these twenty long years?\"\\nRip\\'s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but\\nas one night.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, the company broke up and returned to the more\\nimportant concerns of the election. Rip\\'s daughter took him home to live\\nwith her. She had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout, cheery farmer\\nfor a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to\\nclimb upon his back. Rip now resumed his old walks and habits. He soon\\nfound many of his former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear\\nand tear of time, and preferred making friends among the rising\\ngeneration, with whom he soon grew into great favor.\\n                                                                 --Irving.\\n\\nNOTES.--Rip Van Winkle, according to Irving\\'s story in \"The Sketch Book,\"\\nwas a great drunkard, and was driven from his home in the Catskill\\nMountains, one night, by his wife. Wandering among the mountains, he fell\\nin with the ghosts of Hendrick Hudson and his crew, with whom he played a\\ngame of ninepins. Upon drinking the liquor which they offered him,\\nhowever, he immediately fell into a deep sleep which lasted for twenty\\nyears. The above lesson recounts the events that befell him when he\\nreturned to his native village. In the meantime the Revolution of 1776 had\\ntaken place.\\n\\nThe Federals and the Democrats formed the two leading political parties of\\nthat time.\\n\\nStony Point is a promontory on the Hudson, at the entrance of the\\nHighlands, forty-two miles from New York. It was a fortified post during\\nthe Revolution, captured by the British, and again retaken by the\\nAmericans under Wayne. Anthony\\'s Nose is also a promontory on the Hudson,\\nabout fifteen miles above Stony Point.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXIV. BILL AND JOE. (246)\\n\\nOliver Wendell Holmes, 1809-1894, was the son of Abiel Holmes, D.D. He was\\nborn in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated at Harvard in 1829, having\\nfor classmates several men who have since become distinguished. After\\ngraduating, he studied law for about one year, and then turned his\\nattention to medicine. He studied his profession in Paris, and elsewhere\\nin Europe, and took his degree at Cambridge in 1836. In 1838 he was\\nappointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in Dartmouth College. He\\nremained here but a short time, and then returned to Boston and entered on\\nthe practice of medicine. In 1847 he was appointed professor at Harvard,\\nfilling a similar position to the one held at Dartmouth. He discharged the\\nduties of his professorship for more than thirty years, with great\\nsuccess. Literature was never his profession; yet few American authors\\nattained higher success, both as a poet and as a prose writer. His poems\\nare lively and sparkling, abound in wit and humor, but are not wanting in\\ngenuine pathos. Many of them were composed for special occasions. His\\nprose writings include works on medicine, essays, and novels; several\\nappeared first as contributions to the \"Atlantic Monthly.\" He gained\\nreputation, also, as it popular lecturer. In person, Dr. Holmes was small\\nand active, with a face expressive of thought and vivacity.\\n###\\n\\n\\nCome, dear old comrade, you and I\\nWill steal an hour from days gone by--\\nThe shining days when life was new,\\nAnd all was bright as morning dew,\\nThe lusty days of long ago,\\nWhen you were Bill and I was Joe.\\n\\nYour name may flaunt a titled trail\\nProud as a cockerel\\'s rainbow tail,\\nAnd mine as brief appendix wear\\nAs Tam O\\'Shanter\\'s luckless mare;\\nTo-day, old friend, remember still\\nThat I am Joe and you are Bill.\\n\\nYou\\'ve won the great world\\'s envied prize,\\nAnd grand you look in people\\'s eyes,\\nWith HON. and LL. D.,\\nIn big, brave letters fair to see,--\\nYour fist, old fellow! Off they go!--\\nHow are you, Bill? How are you, Joe?\\n\\nYou\\'ve worn the judge\\'s ermined robe;\\nYou\\'ve taught your name to half the globe;\\nYou\\'ve sung mankind a deathless strain;\\nYou\\'ve made the dead past live again:\\nThe world may call you what it will,\\nBut you and I are Joe and Bill.\\n\\nThe chaffing young folks stare and say,\\n\"See those old buffers, bent and gray;\\nThey talk like fellows in their teens;\\nMad, poor old boys!

Hic jacet Bill.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--Hic jacet (pro. hic ja\\'cet) is a Latin phrase, meaning here lies.\\nIt is frequently used in epitaphs.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXV. SORROW FOR THE DEAD. (249)\\n\\nThe sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be\\ndivorced. Every other wound we seek to heal; every other affliction, to\\nforget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open. This affliction\\nwe cherish, and brood over in solitude. Where is the mother who would\\nwillingly forget the infant that has perished like a blossom from her\\narms, though every recollection is a pang? Where is the child that would\\nwillingly forget a tender parent, though to remember be but to lament?\\nWho, even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend over whom he\\nmourns?\\n\\nNo, the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of\\nthe soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its delights: and when the\\noverwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of\\nrecollection; when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the\\npresent ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive\\nmeditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness, who would\\nroot out such a sorrow from the heart? Though it may, sometimes, throw a\\npassing cloud over the bright hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness\\nover the hour of gloom; yet, who would exchange it even for the song of\\npleasure, or the burst of revelry? No, there is a voice from the tomb\\nsweeter than song. There is a remembrance of the dead, to which we turn\\neven from the charms of the living.\\n\\nOh, the grave! the grave! It buries every error, covers every defect,\\nextinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but\\nfond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave\\neven of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb, that he should have\\nwarred with the poor handful of earth that lies moldering before him? But\\nthe grave of those we loved--what a place for meditation! There it is that\\nwe call up, in long review, the whole history of virtue and gentleness,\\nand the thousand endearments lavished upon us, almost unheeded in the\\ndaily intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell upon the\\ntenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene; the bed of\\ndeath, with all its stifled griefs, its noiseless attendance, its mute,\\nwatchful assiduities! the last testimonies of expiring love! the feeble,\\nfluttering, thrilling,--oh! how thrilling!--pressure of the hand! the last\\nfond look of the glazing eye turning upon us, even from the threshold of\\nexistence! the faint, faltering accents, struggling in death to give one\\nmore assurance of affection!\\n\\nAy, go to the grave of buried love, and meditate! There settle the account\\nwith thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited; every past\\nendearment unregarded, of that departed being, who can never--never--\\nnever return to be soothed by thy contrition! If thou art a child, and\\nhast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or a furrow to the silvered brow of\\nan affectionate parent; if thou art a husband, and hast ever caused the\\nfond bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms to doubt one\\nmoment of thy kindness or thy truth; if thou art a friend, and hast ever\\nwronged, in thought, or word, or deed, the spirit that generously confided\\nin thee; if thou hast given one unmerited pang to that true heart, which\\nnow lies cold and still beneath thy feet; then be sure that every unkind\\nlook, every ungracious word, every ungentle action, will come thronging\\nback upon thy memory, and knocking dolefully at thy soul; then be sure\\nthat thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave, and utter\\nthe unheard groan, and pour the unavailing tear; more deep, more bitter,\\nbecause unheard and unavailing.\\n\\nThen weave thy chaplet of flowers, and strew the beauties of nature about\\nthe grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with these tender,\\nyet futile, tributes of regret: but take warning by the bitterness of\\nthis, thy contrite affliction over the dead, and henceforth be more\\nfaithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living.\\n                                                             --Irving.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXVI. THE EAGLE. (251)\\n\\nJames Gates Percival, 1795-1856, was born at Berlin, Connecticut, and\\ngraduated at Yale College in 1815, at the head of his class. He was\\nadmitted to the practice of medicine in 1820, and went to Charleston,\\nSouth Carolina. In 1824 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at West\\nPoint, a position which he held but a few months. In 1854 he was appointed\\nState Geologist of Wisconsin, and died at Hazel Green, in that state. Dr.\\nPercival was eminent as a geographer, geologist, and linguist. He began to\\nwrite poetry at an early age, and his fame rests chiefly upon his writings\\nin this department. In his private life, Percival was always shy, modest,\\nand somewhat given to melancholy. Financially, his life was one of\\nstruggle, and he was often greatly straitened for money.\\n###\\n\\nBird of the broad and sweeping wing!\\n  Thy home is high in heaven,\\nWhere the wide storms their banners fling,\\n  And the tempest clouds are driven.\\nThy throne is on the mountain top;\\n  Thy fields, the boundless air;\\nAnd hoary peaks, that proudly prop\\n  The skies, thy dwellings are.\\n\\nThou art perched aloft on the beetling crag,\\n  And the waves are white below,\\nAnd on, with a haste that can not lag,\\n  They rush in an endless flow.\\nAgain thou hast plumed thy wing for flight\\n  To lands beyond the sea,\\nAnd away, like a spirit wreathed in light,\\n  Thou hurriest, wild and free.\\n\\nLord of the boundless realm of air!\\n  In thy imperial name,\\nThe hearts of the bold and ardent dare\\n  The dangerous path of fame,\\nBeneath the shade of thy golden wings,\\n  The Roman legions bore,\\nFrom the river of Egypt\\'s cloudy springs,\\n  Their pride, to the polar shore.\\n\\nFor thee they fought, for thee they fell,\\n  And their oath on thee was laid;\\nTo thee the clarions raised their swell,\\n  And the dying warrior prayed.\\nThou wert, through an age of death and fears,\\n  The image of pride and power,\\nTill the gathered rage of a thousand years,\\n  Burst forth in one awful hour.\\n\\nAnd then, a deluge of wrath, it came,\\n  And the nations shook with dread;\\nAnd it swept the earth, till its fields were flame,\\n  And piled with the mingled dead.\\nKings were rolled in the wasteful flood,\\n  With the low and crouching slave;\\nAnd together lay, in a shroud of blood,\\n  The coward and the brave.\\n\\nNOTES.--Roman legions.

(253)\\n\\nThomas Jefferson, 1743-1826, the third President of the United States, and\\nthe author of the Declaration of Independence, was born in Albemarle\\nCounty, Virginia. He received most of his early education under private\\ntutors, and at the age of seventeen entered William and Mary College,\\nwhere he remained two years. At college, where he studied industriously,\\nhe formed the acquaintance of several distinguished men, among them was\\nGeorge Wythe, with whom he entered on the study of law. At the age of\\ntwenty-four he was admitted to the bar, and soon rose to high standing in\\nhis profession. In 1775 he entered the Colonial Congress, having\\npreviously served ably in the legislature of his native state. Although\\none of the youngest men in Congress, he soon took a foremost place in that\\nbody. He left Congress in the fall of 1776, and, as a member of the\\nlegislature, and later as Governor of Virginia, he was chiefly\\ninstrumental in effecting several important reforms in the laws of that\\nstate,--the most notable were the abolition of the law of primogeniture,\\nand the passage of a law making all religious denominations equal. From\\n1785 to 1789 he was Minister to France. On his return to America he was\\nmade Secretary of State, in the first Cabinet. While in this office, he\\nbecame the leader of the Republican or Anti-Federalist party, in\\nopposition to the Federalist party led by Alexander Hamilton. From 1801 to\\n1809 he was President. On leaving his high office, he retired to his\\nestate at \"Monticello,\" where he passed the closing years of his life, and\\ndied on the 4th of July, just fifty years after the passage of his famous\\nDeclaration. His compatriot, and sometimes bitter political opponent, John\\nAdams, died on the same day.\\n\\nMr. Jefferson, who was never a ready public speaker, was a remarkably\\nclear and forcible writer; his works fill several large volumes. In\\npersonal character, he was pure and simple, cheerful, and disposed to look\\non the bright side. His knowledge of life rendered his conversation highly\\nattractive. The chief enterprise of his later years was the founding of\\nthe University of Virginia, at Charlottesville.\\n###\\n\\n\\nDuring the contest of opinion through which we have passed, the animation\\nof discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might\\nimpose on strangers, unused to think freely and to speak and to write what\\nthey think; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation,\\nannounced according to the rules of the constitution, all will, of course,\\narrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in common efforts\\nfor the common good.\\n\\nAll, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that, though the will\\nof the majority is, in all cases, to prevail, that will, to be rightful,\\nmust be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which\\nequal laws must protect, and to violate which would be oppression. Let us\\nthen, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.\\n\\nLet us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection, without\\nwhich liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things; and let us\\nreflect, that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance\\nunder which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have gained little if we\\ncountenance a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of\\nas bitter and bloody persecutions.\\n\\nDuring the throes and convulsions of the ancient world; during the\\nagonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking, through blood and slaughter,\\nhis long-lost liberty; it was not wonderful that the agitation of the\\nbillows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that this\\nshould be more felt and feared by some, and less by others, and should\\ndivide opinions as to measures of safety.\\n\\nBut every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have\\ncalled by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all\\nRepublicans; we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would\\nwish to dissolve this Union, or to change its republican form, let them\\nstand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion\\nmay be tolerated when reason is left free to combat it.\\n\\nI know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government can\\nnot be strong; that this government is not strong enough. But would the\\nhonest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a\\ngovernment which has so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and\\nvisionary fear that this government, the world\\'s best hope, may, by\\npossibility, want energy to preserve itself? I trust not; I believe this,\\non the contrary, the strongest government on earth.\\n\\nI believe it to be the only one where every man, at the call of the law,\\nwould fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the\\npublic order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is said that man\\ncan not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be\\ntrusted with the government of others, or have we found angels, in the\\nform of kings, to govern him? Let history answer this question. Let us,\\nthen, with courage and confidence, pursue our own federal and republican\\nprinciples; our attachment to union and representative government.\\n\\nNOTE.--At the time of Jefferson\\'s election, party spirit ran very high. He\\nhad been defeated by John Adams at the previous presidential election, but\\nthe Federal party, to which Adams belonged, became weakened by their\\nmanagement during difficulties with France; and now Jefferson had been\\nelected president over his formerly successful rival. The above selection\\nis from his inaugural address.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXVIII. WHAT CONSTITUTES A STATE? (255)\\n\\nSir William Jones, 1746-1794, was the son of an eminent mathematician; he\\nearly distinguished himself by his ability as a student. He graduated at\\nOxford, became well versed in Oriental literature, studied law, and wrote\\nmany able books. In 1783 he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of\\nJudicature in Bengal. He was a man of astonishing learning, upright life,\\nand Christian principles.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  What constitutes a state?\\nNot high-raised battlement or labored mound,\\n  Thick wall or moated gate;\\nNot cities proud with spires and turrets crowned;\\n  Not bays and broad-armed ports,\\nWhere, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride;\\n  Not starred and spangled courts,\\nWhere low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride.\\n\\n  No:--men, high-minded men,\\nWith powers as far above dull brutes endued\\n  In forest, brake, or den,\\nAs beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude,--\\n  Men who their duties know,\\nBut know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain,\\n  Prevent the long-aimed blow,\\nAnd crush the tyrant while they rend the chain:\\n  These constitute a state;\\nAnd sovereign Law, that state\\'s collected will,\\n  O\\'er thrones and globes elate,\\nSits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.\\n\\n\\nLXIX. THE BRAVE AT HOME. (256)\\n\\nThomas Buchanan Read, 1822-1872, an American poet and painter, was born in\\nChester County, Pennsylvania. At the age of seventeen he entered a\\nsculptor\\'s studio in Cincinnati. Here he gained reputation as a painter of\\nportraits. From this city he went to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia,\\nand soon after to Florence, Italy. In the later years of his life, he\\ndivided his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome. His complete\\npoetical works fill three volumes. Several of his most stirring poems\\nrelate to the Revolutionary War, and to the late Civil War in America.\\nMany of his poems are marked by vigor and a ringing power, while\\nsmoothness and delicacy distinguish others, no less.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe maid who binds her warrior\\'s sash,\\n  And, smiling, all her pain dissembles,\\nThe while beneath the drooping lash,\\n  One starry tear-drop hangs and trembles;\\nThough Heaven alone records the tear,\\n  And fame shall never know her story,\\nHer heart has shed a drop as dear\\n  As ever dewed the field of glory!\\n\\nThe wife who girds her husband\\'s sword,\\n  \\'Mid little ones who weep and wonder,\\nAnd bravely speaks the cheering word,\\n  What though her heart be rent asunder;--\\nDoomed nightly in her dreams to hear\\n  The bolts of war around him rattle,--\\nHas shed as sacred blood as e\\'er\\n  Was poured upon the field of battle!\\n\\nThe mother who conceals her grief,\\n  While to her breast her son she presses,\\nThen breathes a few brave words and brief,\\n  Kissing the patriot brow she blesses;\\nWith no one but her loving God,\\n  To know the pain that weighs upon her,\\nSheds holy blood as e\\'er the sod\\n  Received on Freedom\\'s field of honor!\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The above selection is from the poem entitled \"The Wagoner of the\\nAlleghanies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLXX. SOUTH CAROLINA. (257)\\n\\nRobert Young Hayne, 1791-1840, was born in Colleton District, South\\nCarolina, and studied and practiced law at Charleston. He was early\\nelected to the State Legislature, and became Speaker of the House and\\nAttorney-general of the state. He entered the Senate of the United States\\nat the age of thirty-one. He was Governor of South Carolina during the\\n\"Nullification\" troubles in 1832 and 1833. Mr. Hayne was a clear and able\\ndebater, and a stanch advocate of the extreme doctrine of \"State Rights.\"\\nIn the Senate he opposed the Tariff Bill of 1828; and, out of this\\nstruggle, grew his famous debate with Daniel Webster in 1830. The\\nfollowing selection is an extract from Mr. Hayne\\'s speech on that\\nmemorable occasion.\\n###\\n\\n\\nIf there be one state in the Union, Mr. President, that may challenge\\ncomparison with any other, for a uniform, zealous, ardent, and\\nuncalculating devotion to the Union, that state is South Carolina. Sir,\\nfrom the very commencement of the Revolution, up to this hour, there is no\\nsacrifice, however great, she has not cheerfully made; no service she has\\never hesitated to perform.\\n\\nShe has adhered to you in your prosperity; but in your adversity she has\\nclung to you with more than filial affection. No matter what was the\\ncondition of her domestic affairs; though deprived of her resources,\\ndivided by parties, or surrounded by difficulties, the call of the country\\nhas been to her as the voice of God. Domestic discord ceased at the sound;\\nevery man became at once reconciled to his brethren, and the sons of\\nCarolina were all seen, crowding to the temple, bringing their gifts to\\nthe altar of their common country.\\n\\nWhat, sir, was the conduct of the South, during the Revolution? Sir, I\\nhonor New England for her conduct in that glorious struggle. But great as\\nis the praise which belongs to her, I think at least equal honor is due to\\nthe South. Never were there exhibited, in the history of the world, higher\\nexamples of noble daring, dreadful suffering, and heroic endurance, than\\nby the whigs of Carolina, during the Revolution. The whole state, from the\\nmountains to the sea, was overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy.\\nThe fruits of industry perished on the spot where they were produced, or\\nwere consumed by the foe.\\n\\nThe plains of Carolina drank up the most precious blood of her citizens.\\nBlack, smoking ruins marked the places which had been the habitation of\\nher children. Driven from their homes into the gloomy and almost\\nimpenetrable swamps, even there the spirit of liberty survived, and South\\nCarolina, sustained by the example of her Sumters and her Marions, proved,\\nby her conduct, that though her soil might be overrun, the spirit of her\\npeople was invincible.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Thomas Sumter (b. 1734, d. 1832) was by birth a Virginian, but\\nduring the Revolution commanded South Carolina troops. He was one of the\\nmost active and able of the Southern generals, and, after the war, was\\nprominent in politics. He was the last surviving general of the\\nRevolution.\\n\\nFrancis Marion (b. 1732, d. 1795), known as the \"Swamp Fox,\" was a native\\nSouth Carolinian, of French descent. Marion\\'s brigade became noted during\\nthe Revolution for its daring and surprising attacks. See Lesson CXXXV.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXI. MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTH CAROLINA. (259)\\n\\nDaniel Webster, 1782-1852. This celebrated American statesman and orator\\nwas born in Salisbury, New Hampshire. His father, Ebenezer Webster, was a\\npioneer settler, a soldier in the Old French War and the Revolution, and a\\nman of ability and strict integrity, Daniel attended the common school in\\nhis youth, and fitted for college under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boseawen,\\ngraduating at Dartmouth in 1801. He spent a few months of his boyhood at\\n\"Phillips Academy,\" Exeter, where he attained distinction as a student,\\nbut was so diffident that he could never give a declamation before his\\nclass. During his college course, and later, he taught school several\\nterms in order to increase his slender finances. He was admitted to the\\nbar in Boston in 1805. For the next eleven years, he practiced his\\nprofession in his native state. In 1812 he was elected to the United\\nStates House of Representatives, and at once took his place as one of the\\nmost prominent men of that body. In 1816 he removed to Boston; and in 1827\\nhe was elected to the United States Senate, where he continued for twelve\\nyears. In 1841 he was made Secretary of State, and soon after negotiated\\nthe famous \"Ashburton Treaty\" with England, settling the northern boundary\\nof the United States. In 1845 he returned to the Senate; and in 1850 he\\nwas re-appointed Secretary of State, and continued in office till his\\ndeath. He died at his country residence in Marshfield, Massachusetts.\\n\\nMr. Webster\\'s fame rests chiefly on his state papers and his speeches in\\nCongress; but he took a prominent part in some of the most famous law\\ncases of the present century. Several of his public addresses on\\noccasional themes are well known, also. As a speaker, he was dignified and\\nstately, using clear, straightforward, pure English. He had none of the\\ntricks of oratory. He was large of person, with a massive head, a swarthy\\ncomplexion, and deep-set, keen, and lustrous eyes. His grand presence\\nadded much to his power as a speaker.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe eulogium pronounced on the character of the State of South Carolina by\\nthe honorable gentleman, for her Revolutionary and other merits, meets my\\nhearty concurrence. I shall not acknowledge that the honorable member goes\\nbefore me, in regard for whatever of distinguished talent or distinguished\\ncharacter South Carolina has produced. I claim part of the honor; I\\npartake in the pride of her great names. I claim them for countrymen, one\\nand all--the Laurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the Sumters, the\\nMarions--Americans all--whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by state\\nlines than their talents and patriotism were capable of being\\ncircumscribed within the same narrow limits.\\n\\nIn their day and generation, they served and honored the country, and the\\nwhole country, and their renown is of the treasures of the whole country.\\nHim whose honored name the gentleman himself bears,--does he suppose me\\nless capable of gratitude for his patriotism, or sympathy for his\\nsuffering, than if his eyes had first opened upon the light in\\nMassachusetts, instead of South Carolina? Sir, does he suppose it in his\\npower to exhibit in Carolina a name so bright as to produce envy in my\\nbosom? No, sir,--increased gratification and delight rather. Sir, I thank\\nGod that, if I am gifted with little of the spirit which is said to be\\nable to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as I trust, of that\\nother spirit which would drag angels down.\\n\\nWhen I shall be found, sir, in my place here in the Senate, or elsewhere,\\nto sneer at public merit because it happened to spring up beyond the\\nlittle limits of my own state or neighborhood; when I refuse for any such\\ncause, or for any cause, the homage due to American talent, to elevated\\npatriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty and the country; or if I see an\\nuncommon endowment of Heaven; if I see extraordinary capacity or virtue in\\nany son of the South; and if, moved by local prejudice, or gangrened by\\nstate jealousy, I get up here to abate a tithe of a hair from his just\\ncharacter and just fame, may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\\n\\nMr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts. She needs\\nnone. There she is; behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is her\\nhistory; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is secure. There\\nis Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there they\\nwill remain forever. And, sir, where American Liberty raised its first\\nvoice, and where its youth was nurtured and sustained, there it still\\nlives, in the strength of its manhood, and full of its original spirit. If\\ndiscord and disunion shall wound it; if party strife and blind ambition\\nshall hawk at and tear it; if folly and madness, if uneasiness under\\nsalutary restraint, shall succeed to separate it from that Union, by which\\nalone its existence is made sure, it will stand, in the end, by the side\\nof that cradle in which its infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth its\\narm, with whatever of vigor it may still retain, over the friends who\\ngathered around it; and it will fall at last, if fall it must, amid the\\nproudest monuments of its glory and on the very spot of its origin.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The Laurenses were of French descent. Henry Laurens was appointed\\non the commission with Franklin and Jay to negotiate the treaty of peace\\nat Paris at the close of the Revolution. His son, John Laurens, was an aid\\nand secretary of Washington, who was greatly attached to him.\\n\\nThe Rutledges were of Irish descent. John Rutledge was a celebrated\\nstatesman and lawyer. He was appointed Chief Justice of the United States,\\nbut the Senate, for political reasons, refused to confirm his appointment.\\n\\n\\nEdward Rutledge, brother of the preceding, was Governor of South Carolina\\nduring the last two years of his life.\\n\\nThe Pinckneys were an old English family who emigrated to Charleston in\\n1687. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and his brother Thomas were both active\\nparticipants in the Revolution. The former was an unsuccessful candidate\\nfor the presidency of the United States, in 1800.\\n\\nThomas was elected governor of South Carolina in 1789. In the war of 1812\\nhe served as major-general.\\n\\nCharles Pinckney, a second cousin of the two already mentioned, was four\\ntimes elected governor of his state.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXII. THE CHURCH SCENE FROM EVANGELINE. (262)\\n\\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807-1882, the son of Hon. Stephen Longfellow,\\nan eminent lawyer of Portland, Maine, was born in that city. He graduated,\\nat the age of eighteen, at Bowdoin College. He was soon appointed to the\\nchair of Modern Languages and Literature in that institution, and, to fit\\nhimself further for his work, he went abroad and spent four years in\\nEurope. He remained at Bowdoin till 1835, when he was appointed to the\\nchair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in Harvard University. On\\nreceiving this appointment, he again went to Europe and remained two\\nyears. He resigned his professorship in 1854, and after that time resided\\nin Cambridge, pursuing his literary labors and giving to the public, from\\ntime to time, the fruits of his pen. In 1868 he made a voyage to England,\\nwhere he was received with extraordinary marks of honor and esteem. In\\naddition to Mr. Longfellow\\'s original works, both in poetry and in prose,\\nhe distinguished himself by several translations; the most famous is that\\nof the works of Dante.\\n\\nMr. Longfellow\\'s poetry is always elegant and chaste, showing in every\\nline traces of his careful scholarship. Yet it is not above the popular\\ntaste or comprehension, as is shown by the numerous and varied editions of\\nhis poems. Many of his poems treat of historical themes; \"Evangeline,\"\\nfrom which the following selection is taken, is esteemed by many as the\\nmost beautiful of all his longer poems; it was first published in 1847.\\n###\\n\\n\\nSo passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous\\nSounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drumbeat.\\nThronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,\\nAwaited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones\\nGarlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.\\nThen came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them\\nEntered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor\\nEchoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,--\\nEchoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal\\nClosed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.\\n\\nThen uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar,\\nHolding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.\\n\"You have convened this day,\" he said, \"by his Majesty\\'s orders.\\nClement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness,\\nLet your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper\\nPainful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.\\nYet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch;\\nNamely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds\\nForfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province\\nBe transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there\\nEver as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!\\nPrisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty\\'s pleasure!\"\\n\\nAs, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,\\nSuddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones\\nBeats down the farmer\\'s corn in the field and shatters his windows,\\nHiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house roofs,\\nBellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their inclosure;\\nSo on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.\\nSilent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose\\nLouder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,\\nAnd, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the doorway.\\n\\nVain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations\\nRang through the house of prayer; and high o\\'er the heads of the others\\nRose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,\\nAs, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.\\nFlushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,--\\n\"Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!\\nDeath to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!\"\\nMore he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier\\nSmote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.\\n\\nIn the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,\\nLo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician\\nEntered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the alter.\\nRaising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence\\nAll that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;\\nDeep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful\\nSpake he, as, after the tocsin\\'s alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.\\n\\n\"What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?\\nForty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,\\nNot in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!\\nIs this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?\\nHave you so soon forgotten all the lessons of love and forgiveness?\\nThis is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it\\nThus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?\\nLo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!\\nSee! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!\\nHark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, \\'O Father, forgive them!\\'\\nLet us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,\\nLet us repeat it now, and say, \\'O Father, forgive them.\\' \"\\n\\nFew were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people\\nSank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,\\nWhile they repeated his prayer, and said, \"O Father, forgive them!\"\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--Nova Scotia was first settled by the French, but, in 1713, was\\nceded to the English. The inhabitants refusing either to take the oath of\\nallegiance or to bear arms against their fellow-countrymen in the French\\nand Indian War, it was decided to remove the whole people, and distribute\\nthem among the other British provinces. This was accordingly done in 1755.\\nThe villages were burned to the ground, and the people hurried on board\\nthe ships in such a way that but a few families remained undivided.\\n\\nLongfellow\\'s poem of \"Evangeline\" is founded on this incident, and the\\nabove selection describes the scene where the male inhabitants of\\nGrand-Pre\\' are assembled in the church, and the order for their banishment\\nis first made known to them.\\n\\n\\nLXXIII. SONG OF THE SHIRT. (266)\\n\\nThomas Hood, 1798-1845, the son of a London bookseller, was born in that\\ncity. He undertook, after leaving school, to learn the art of an engraver,\\nbut soon gave up the business, and turned his attention to literature. His\\nlighter pieces, exhibiting his skill as a wit and punster, soon became\\nwell known and popular. In 1821 he became subeditor of the \"London\\nMagazine,\" and formed the acquaintance of the literary men of the\\nmetropolis. The last years of his life were clouded by poverty and ill\\nhealth. Some of his most humorous pieces were written on a sick bed. Hood\\nis best known as a joker--a writer of \"whims and oddities\"--but he was no\\nmere joker. Some of his pieces are filled with the tenderest pathos; and a\\ngentle spirit, in love with justice and humanity, pervades even his\\nlighter compositions. His \"Song of the Shirt\" first appeared in the\\n\"London Punch.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nWith fingers weary and worn,\\n  With eyelids heavy and red,\\nA woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\\n  Plying her needle and thread:\\nStitch! stitch! stitch!\\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,\\nAnd still with a voice of dolorous pitch,\\n  She sang the \"Song of the Shirt!\"\\n\\n  \"Work! work! work!\\nWhile the cock is crowing aloof!\\n  And work! work! work!\\nTill the stars shine through the roof!\\n  It is oh to be a slave\\nAlong with the barbarous Turk,\\n  Where woman has never a soul to save,\\nIf this is Christian work!\\n\\n  \"Work! work! work!\\nTill the brain begins to swim;\\n  Work! work! work!\\nTill the eyes are heavy and dim!\\n  Seam, and gusset, and band,\\nBand, and gusset, and seam,\\n  Till over the buttons I fall asleep,\\nAnd sew them on in a dream!\\n\\n  \"O men, with sisters dear!\\n   O men, with mothers and wives!\\nIt is not linen you\\'re wearing out,\\n  But human creatures\\' lives!\\n    Stitch! stitch! stitch!\\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,--\\nSewing at once, with a double thread,\\n  A shroud as well as a shirt.\\n\\n \"But why do I talk of Death?\\n  That Phantom of grisly bone,\\nI hardly fear his terrible shape,\\n  It seems so like my own;\\n  It seems so like my own,\\n  Because of the fasts I keep;\\nO God! that bread should be so dear,\\n  And flesh and blood so cheap!\\n\\n  \"Work! work! work!\\nMy labor never flags;\\n  And what are its wages? A bed of straw,\\nA crust of bread--and rags,\\n  That shattered roof--and this naked floor--\\nA table--a broken chair--\\n  And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank\\nFor sometimes falling there.\\n\\n  \"Work! work! work!\\nFrom weary chime to chime!\\n  Work! work! work!\\nAs prisoners work for crime!\\n  Band, and gusset, and seam,\\n  Seam, and gusset, and band,\\nTill the heart is sick, and the brain benumbed,\\n  As well as the weary hand.\\n\\n  \"Work! work! work!\\nIn the dull December light,\\n  And work! work! work!\\nWhen the weather is warm and bright;\\nWhile underneath the eaves\\n  The brooding swallows cling,\\nAs if to show me their sunny backs,\\n  And twit me with the spring.\\n\\n  \"Oh but to breathe the breath\\n  Of the cowslip and primrose sweet!\\nWith the sky above my head,\\n  And the grass beneath my feet!\\nFor only one short hour\\n  To feel as I used to feel,\\nBefore I knew the woes of want,\\n  And the walk that costs a meal!\\n\\n  \"Oh but for one short hour,--\\n  A respite, however brief!\\nNo blessed leisure for love or hope,\\n  But only time for grief!\\nA little weeping would ease my heart,\\n  But in their briny bed\\nMy tears must stop, for every drop\\n  Hinders needle and thread.\"\\n\\nWith fingers weary and worn,\\n  With eyelids heavy and red,\\nA woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\\n  Plying her needle and thread:\\n    Stitch! stitch! stitch!\\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,\\nAnd still with a voice of dolorous pitch--\\nWould that its tone could reach the rich!\\n  She sang this \"Song of the Shirt.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXIV. DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND. (269)\\n\\nEdouard Rene Lefebvre-Laboulaye, 1811-1883, was a French writer of note.\\nMost of his works involve questions of law and politics, and are\\nconsidered high authority on the questions discussed. A few works, such as\\n\"Abdallah,\" from which the following extract is adapted, were written as a\\nmere recreation in the midst of law studies; they show great imaginative\\npower. Laboulaye took great interest in the United States, her people, and\\nher literature; and many of his works are devoted to American questions.\\nHe translated the works of Dr. William E. Channing into French.\\n###\\n\\n\\nMansour, the Egyptian merchant, one day repaired to the cadi on account of\\na suit, the issue of which troubled him but little. A private conversation\\nwith the judge had given him hopes of the justice of his cause. The old\\nman asked his son Omar to accompany him in order to accustom him early to\\ndeal with the law.\\n\\nThe cadi was seated in the courtyard of the mosque. He was a fat,\\ngood-looking man, who never thought, and talked little, which, added to\\nhis large turban and his air of perpetual astonishment, gave him a great\\nreputation for justice and gravity.\\n\\nThe spectators were numerous; the principal merchants were seated on the\\nground on carpets, forming a semicircle around the magistrate. Mansour\\ntook his seat a little way from the sheik, and Omar placed himself between\\nthe two, his curiosity strongly excited to see how the law was obeyed, and\\nhow it was trifled with in case of need.\\n\\nThe first case called was that of a young Banian, as yellow as an orange,\\nwith loose flowing robes and an effeminate air, who had lately landed from\\nIndia, and who complained of having been cheated by one of Mansour\\'s\\nrivals.\\n\\n\"Having found a casket of diamonds among the effects left by my father,\"\\nsaid he, \"I set out for Egypt, to live there on the proceeds of their\\nsale. I was obliged by bad weather to put into Jidda, where I soon found\\nmyself in want of money. I went to the bazaar, and inquired for a dealer\\nin precious stones. The richest, I was told, was Mansour; the most honest,\\nAli, the jeweler. I applied to Ali.\\n\\n\"He welcomed me as a son, as soon as he learned that I had diamonds to\\nsell, and carried me home with him. He gained my confidence by every kind\\nof attention, and advanced me all the money I needed. One day, after\\ndinner, at which wine was not wanting, he examined the diamonds, one by\\none, and said, \\'My child, these diamonds are of little value; my coffers\\nare full of such stones. The rocks of the desert furnish them by\\nthousands.\\'\\n\\n\"To prove the truth of what he said, he opened a box, and, taking\\ntherefrom a diamond thrice as large as any of mine, gave it to the slave\\nthat was with me. \\'What will become of me?\\' I cried; \\'I thought myself\\nrich, and here I am, poor, and a stranger.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'My child,\\' replied Ali, \\'Leave this casket with me, and I will give you\\na price for it such as no one else would offer. Choose whatever you wish\\nin Jidda, and in two hours I will give you an equal weight of what you\\nhave chosen in exchange for your Indian stones.\\'\\n\\n\"On returning home, night brought reflection. I learned that Ali had been\\ndeceiving me. What he had given to the slave was nothing but a bit of\\ncrystal. I demanded my casket. Ali refused to restore it. Venerable\\nmagistrate, my sole hope is in your justice.\"\\n\\nIt was now Ali\\'s turn to speak. \"Illustrious cadi,\" said he, \"It is true\\nthat we made a bargain, which I am ready to keep, The rest of the young\\nman\\'s story is false. What matters it what I gave the slave? Did I force\\nthe stranger to leave the casket in my hands? Why does he accuse me of\\ntreachery? Have I broken my word, and has he kept his?\"\\n\\n\"Young man,\" said the cadi to the Banian, \"have you witnesses to prove\\nthat Ali deceived you? If not, I shall put the accused on his oath, as the\\nlaw decrees.\" A Koran was brought. Ali placed his hand on it, and swore\\nthree times that he had not deceived the stranger. \"Wretch,\" said the\\nBanian, \"thou art among those whose feet go down to destruction. Thou hast\\nthrown away thy soul.\"\\n\\nOmar smiled, and while Ali was enjoying the success of his ruse, he\\napproached the stranger, and asked, \"Do you wish me to help you gain the\\nsuit?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply; \"but you are only a child--you can do\\nnothing.\"\\n\\n\"Have confidence in me a few moments,\" said Omar; \"accept Ali\\'s bargain;\\nlet me choose in your stead, and fear nothing.\"\\n\\nThe stranger bowed his head, and murmured, \"What can I fear after having\\nlost all?\" Then, turning to the cadi, and bowing respectfully, \"Let the\\nbargain be consummated,\" said he, \"since the law decrees it, and let this\\nyoung man choose in my stead what I shall receive in payment.\"\\n\\nA profound silence ensued. Omar rose, and, bowing to the cadi, \"Ali,\" said\\nhe to the jeweler, \"you have doubtless brought the casket, and can tell us\\nthe weight thereof.\"\\n\\n\"Here it is,\" said Ali; \"it weighs twenty pounds. Choose what you will; if\\nthe thing asked for is in Jidda, you shall have it within two hours,\\notherwise the bargain is null and void.\"\\n\\n\"What we desire,\" said Omar, raising his voice, \"is ants\\' wings, half male\\nand half female. You have two hours in which to furnish the twenty pounds\\nyou have promised us.\" \"This is absurd,\" cried the jeweler; \"it is\\nimpossible. I should need half a score of persons and six months labor to\\nsatisfy so foolish a demand.\"\\n\\n\"Are there any winged ants in Jidda?\" asked the cadi. \"Of course,\"\\nanswered the merchants, laughing; \"they are one of the plagues of Egypt.\\nOur houses are full of them, and it would be doing us a great service to\\nrid us of them.\"\\n\\n\"Then Ali must keep his promise or give back the casket,\" said the cadi.\\n\"This young man was mad to sell his diamonds weight for weight; he is mad\\nto exact such payment. So much the better for Ali the first time: so much\\nthe worse for him the second.  Justice has not two weights and measures.\\nEvery bargain holds good before the law. Either furnish twenty pounds of\\nants\\' wings, or restore the casket to the Banian.\" \"A righteous judgment,\"\\nshouted the spectators, wonder-struck at such equity.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: In front of a middle-eastern building; a man seated with a\\nsword and water-pipe, facing a crowd. A small boy with his left arm\\noutstreached, is speaking to the man. A taller young man stands to the\\nright of the small boy; an older man stands further to the right.]\\n\\n\\nThe stranger, beside himself with joy, took from the casket three diamonds\\nof the finest water; he forced them on Omar, who put them in his girdle,\\nand seated himself by his father, his gravity unmoved by the gaze of the\\nassembly. \"Well done,\" said Mansour; \"but it is my turn now; mark me well,\\nand profit by the lesson I shall give you. Stop, young man!\" he cried to\\nthe Banian, \"we have an account to settle.\"\\n\\n\"The day before yesterday,\" continued he, \"this young man entered my shop,\\nand, bursting into tears, kissed my hand and entreated me to sell him a\\nnecklace which I had already sold to the Pasha of Egypt, saying that his\\nlife and that of a lady depended upon it. \\'Ask of me what you will, my\\nfather,\\' said he, \\'but I must have these gems or die.\\'\\n\\n\"I have a weakness for young men, and, though I knew the danger of\\ndisappointing my master the pasha, I was unable to resist his\\nsupplications. \\'Take the necklace,\\' said I to him, \\'but promise to give\\nwhatever I may ask in exchange.\\' \\'My head itself, if you will,\\' he\\nreplied, \\'for you have saved my life,\\' We were without witnesses, but,\"\\nadded Mansour, turning to the Banian, \"is not my story true?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the young man, \"and I beg your pardon for not having satisfied\\nyou sooner: you know the cause. Ask of me what you desire.\"\\n\\n\"What I desire,\" said Mansour, \"is the casket with all its contents.\\nIllustrious magistrate, you have declared that all bargains hold good\\nbefore the law; this young man has promised to give me what I please; now\\nI declare that nothing pleases me but these diamonds.\"\\n\\nThe cadi raised his head and looked about the assembly, as if to\\ninterrogate the faces, then stroked his beard, and relapsed into his\\nmeditations.\\n\\n\"Ali is defeated,\" said the sheik to Omar, with a smile, \"The fox is not\\nyet born more cunning than the worthy Mansour.\"\\n\\n\"I am lost!\" cried the Banian. \"O Omar, have you saved me only to cast me\\ndown from the highest pinnacle of joy to the depths of despair? Persuade\\nyour father to spare me, that I may owe my life to you a second time.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my son,\" said Mansour, \"doubtless you are shrewd, but this will\\nteach you that your father knows rather more than you do. The cadi is\\nabout to decide: try whether you can dictate his decree.\"\\n\\n\"It is mere child\\'s play,\" answered Omar, shrugging his shoulders; \"but\\nsince you desire it, my father, you shall lose your suit.\" He rose, and\\ntaking a piaster from his girdle, put it into the hand of the Banian, who\\nlaid it before the judge.\\n\\n\"Illustrious cadi,\" said Omar, \"this young man is ready to fulfill his\\nengagement. This is what he offers Mansour--piaster. In itself this coin\\nis of little value; but examine it closely, and you will see that it is\\nstamped with the likeness of the sultan, our glorious master. May God\\ndestroy and confound all who disobey his highness!\\n\\n\"It is this precious likeness that we offer you,\" added he, turning to\\nMansour; \"if it pleases you, you are paid; to say that it displeases you\\nis an insult to the pasha, a crime punishable by death; and I am sure that\\nour worthy cadi will not become your accomplice--he who has always been\\nand always will be the faithful servant of an the sultans.\"\\n\\nWhen Omar had finished speaking, all eyes turned toward the cadi, who,\\nmore impenetrable than ever, stroked his face and waited for the old man\\nto come to his aid. Mansour was agitated and embarrassed. The silence of\\nthe cadi and the assembly terrified him, and he cast a supplicating glance\\ntoward his son.\\n\\n\"My father,\" said Omar, \"permit this young man to thank you for the lesson\\nof prudence which you have given him by frightening him a little. He knows\\nwell that it was you who sent me to his aid, and that all this is a farce.\\nNo one is deceived by hearing the son oppose the Father, and who has ever\\ndoubted Mansour\\'s experience and generosity?\"\\n\\n\"No one,\" interrupted the cadi, starting up like a man suddenly awakened\\nfrom a dream, \"and I least of all; and this is why I have permitted you to\\nspeak, my young Solomon. I wished to honor in you the wisdom of your\\nfather; but another time avoid meddling with his highness\\'s name; it is\\nnot safe to sport with the lion\\'s paws. The matter is settled. The\\nnecklace is worth a hundred thousand piasters, is it not, Mansour?

THANATOPSIS. (275)\\n\\nTo him who in the love of Nature holds\\nCommunion with her visible forms, she speaks\\nA various language: for his gayer hours\\nShe has a voice  of gladness, and a smile\\nAnd eloquence of beauty; and she glides\\nInto his darker musings, with a mild\\nAnd healing sympathy, that steals away\\nTheir sharpness, ere he is aware.\\n                             When thoughts\\nOf the last hitter hour come like a blight\\nOver thy spirit, and sad images\\nOf the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,\\nAnd breathless darkness, and the narrow house,\\nMake thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--\\nGo forth, under the open sky, and list\\nTo Nature\\'s teachings, while from all around--\\nEarth and her waters, and the depths of air--\\nComes a still voice,--\\n\\n                     Yet a few days, and thee\\nThe all-beholding sun shall see no more\\nIn all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,\\nWhere thy pale form was laid, with many tears,\\nNor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist\\nThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim\\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again;\\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\\nTo mix forever with the elements;\\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\\nTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\\nShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.\\n\\n  Yet not to thine eternal resting place\\nShalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish\\nCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\\nWith patriarchs of the infant world,--with kings,\\nThe powerful of the earth,--the wise, the good,\\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,--\\nAll in one mighty sepulcher.\\n\\n                                 The hills,\\nRock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales\\nStretching in pensive quietness between;\\nThe venerable woods; rivers that move\\nIn majesty, and the complaining brooks,\\nThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\\nOld Ocean\\'s gray and melancholy waste,--\\nAre but the solemn decorations all\\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\\nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death,\\nThrough the still lapse of ages.\\n\\n                              All that tread\\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\\nThat slumber in its bosom. Take the wings\\nOf morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,\\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\\nWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound\\nSave his own dashings,--yet the dead are there:\\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\\nIn their last sleep,--the dead reign there alone.\\n\\nSo shalt thou rest; and what if thou withdraw\\nIn silence from the living, and no friend\\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe\\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\\nHis favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave\\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come\\nAnd make their bed with thee. As the long train\\nOf ages glide away, the sons of men--\\nThe youth in life\\'s green spring, and he who goes\\nIn the full strength of years, matron and maid,\\nThe speechless babe, and the gray-headed man\\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side\\nBy those who in their turn shall follow them.\\n\\n  So live, that when thy summons comes to join\\nThe innumerable caravan, which moves\\nTo that mysterious realm, where each shall take\\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\\nThou go not, like the quarry slave at night,\\nScourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\\nBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,\\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\\n--Bryant.\\n\\nNOTES.--Thanatopsis is composed of two Greek words, thanatos, meaning\\ndeath, and opsis, a view.

(278)\\n\\nWilliam Hazlitt, 1778-1830, was born in Maidstone, England. His father was\\na Unitarian clergyman, and he was sent to a college of that denomination\\nto be educated for the ministry; but having a greater taste for art than\\ntheology, he resolved, on leaving school, to devote himself to painting.\\nHe succeeded so well in his efforts as to meet the warmest commendation of\\nhis friends, but did not succeed in satisfying his own fastidious taste.\\nOn this account he threw away his pencil and took up his pen. His works,\\nthough numerous, are, with the exception of a life of Napoleon, chiefly\\ncriticisms on literature and art.\\n\\nHazlitt is thought to have treated his contemporaries with an unjust\\nseverity; but his genial appreciation of the English classics, and the\\nthorough and loving manner in which he discusses their merits, make his\\nessays the delight of every lover of those perpetual wellsprings of\\nintellectual pleasure. His \"Table Talk,\" \"Characters of Shakespeare\\'s\\nPlays,\" \"Lectures on the English Poets,\" and \"Lectures on the Literature\\nof the Elizabethan Age,\" are the works that exhibit his style and general\\nmerits in their most favorable light.\\n###\\n\\n\\nComing forward and seating himself on the ground, in his white dress and\\ntightened turban, the chief of the Indian jugglers begins with tossing up\\ntwo brass balls, which is what any of us could do, and concludes by\\nkeeping up four at the same time, which is what none of us could do to\\nsave our lives, not if we were to take our whole lives to do it in.\\n\\nIs it then a trifling power we see at work, or is it not something next to\\nmiraculous? It is the utmost stretch of human ingenuity, which nothing but\\nthe bending the faculties of body and mind to it from the tenderest\\ninfancy with incessant, ever-anxious application up to manhood, can\\naccomplish or make even a slight approach to. Man, thou art a wonderful\\nanimal, and thy ways past finding out! Thou canst do strange things, but\\nthou turnest them to small account!\\n\\nTo conceive of this extraordinary dexterity, distracts the imagination and\\nmakes admiration breathless. Yet it costs nothing to the performer, any\\nmore than if it were a mere mechanical deception with which he had nothing\\nto do, but to watch and laugh at the astonishment of the spectators. A\\nsingle error of a hair\\'s breadth, of the smallest conceivable portion of\\ntime, would be fatal; the precision of the movements must be like a\\nmathematical truth; their rapidity is like lightning.\\n\\nTo catch four balls in succession, in less than a second of time, and\\ndeliver them back so as to return with seeming consciousness to the hand\\nagain; to make them revolve around him at certain intervals, like the\\nplanets in their spheres; to make them chase each other like sparkles of\\nfire, or shoot up like flowers or meteors; to throw them behind his back,\\nand twine them round his neck like ribbons, or like serpents; to do what\\nappears an impossibility, and to do it with all the ease, the grace, the\\ncarelessness imaginable; to laugh at, to play with the glittering\\nmockeries, to follow them with his eye as if he could fascinate them with\\nits lambent fire, or as if he had only to see that they kept time with the\\nmusic on the stage--there is something in all this which he who does not\\nadmire may be quite sure he never really admired anything in the whole\\ncourse of his life. It is skill surmounting difficulty, and beauty\\ntriumphing over skill. It seems as if the difficulty, once mastered,\\nnaturally resolved itself into ease and grace, and as if, to be overcome\\nat all, it must be overcome without an effort. The smallest awkwardness or\\nwant of pliancy or self-possession would stop the whole process. It is the\\nwork of witchcraft, and yet sport for children.\\n\\nSome of the other feats are quite as curious and wonderful--such as the\\nbalancing the artificial tree, and shooting a bird from each branch\\nthrough a quill--though none of them have the elegance or facility of the\\nkeeping up of the brass balls. You are in pain for the result, and glad\\nwhen the experiment is over; they are not accompanied with the same\\nunmixed, unchecked delight as the former; and I would not give much to be\\nmerely astonished without being pleased at the same time. As to the\\nswallowing of the sword, the police ought to interfere to prevent it.\\n\\nWhen I saw the Indian juggler do the same things before, his feet were\\nbare, and he had large rings on his toes, which he kept turning round all\\nthe time of the performance, as if they moved of themselves.\\n\\nThe hearing a speech in Parliament drawled or stammered out by the\\nhonorable member or the noble lord, the ringing the changes on their\\ncommonplaces, which anyone could repeat after them as well as they, stirs\\nme not a jot,--shakes not my good opinion of myself. I ask what there is\\nthat I can do as well as this. Nothing. What have I been doing all my\\nlife? Have I been idle, or have I nothing to show for all my labor and\\npains? Or have I passed my time in pouring words like water into empty\\nsieves, rolling a stone up a hill and then down again, trying to prove an\\nargument in the teeth of facts, and looking for causes in the dark, and\\nnot finding them? Is there no one thing in which I can challenge\\ncompetition, that I can bring as an instance of exact perfection, in which\\nothers can not find a flaw?\\n\\nThe utmost I can pretend to is to write a description of what this fellow\\ncan do. I can write a book: so can many others who have not even learned\\nto spell. What abortions are these essays! What errors, what ill-pieced\\ntransitions, what crooked reasons, what lame conclusions! How little is\\nmade out, and that little how ill! Yet they are the best I can do.\\n\\nI endeavor to recollect all I have ever heard or thought upon a subject,\\nand to express it as neatly as I can. Instead of writing on four subjects\\nat a time, it is as much as I can manage, to keep the thread of one\\ndiscourse clear and unentangled. I have also time on my hands to correct\\nmy opinions and polish my periods; but the one I can not, and the other I\\nwill not, do. I am fond of arguing; yet, with a good deal of pains and\\npractice, it is often much as I can do to beat my man, though he may be a\\nvery indifferent hand. A common fencer would disarm his adversary in the\\ntwinkling of an eye, unless he were a professor like himself. A stroke of\\nwit will sometimes produce this effect, but there is no such power or\\nsuperiority in sense or reasoning. There is no complete mastery of\\nexecution to be shown there; and you hardly know the professor from the\\nimpudent pretender or the mere clown.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXVII. ANTONY OVER CAESAR\\'S DEAD BODY.

C.) was the most remarkable\\ngenius of the ancient world, Caesar ruled Rome as imperator five years and\\na half, and, in the intervals of seven campaigns during that time, spent\\nonly fifteen months in Rome.

THE ENGLISH CHARACTER. (286)\\n\\nWilliam Hickling Prescott, 1796-1859, the historian, was the son of\\nWilliam Prescott, an eminent jurist, and the grandson of Col. William\\nPrescott, who commanded the Americans at the battle of Bunker Hill. He was\\nborn in Salem, Massachusetts, graduated at Harvard University in 1814, and\\ndied in Boston. Just as he was completing his college course, the careless\\nsport of a fellow-student injured one of his eyes so seriously that he\\nnever recovered from it. He had intended to adopt law as his profession;\\nbut, from his detective eyesight, he was obliged to choose work in which\\nhe could regulate his hours of labor, and could employ the aid of a\\nsecretary. He chose to be a historian; and followed his choice with\\nwonderful system, perseverance, and success till the close of his life.\\nHis works are: \"The Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,\" \"The Conquest of\\nMexico,\" \"The Conquest of Peru,\" \"The Reign of Philip II,\" and a volume of\\n\"Miscellanies.\" He had not completed the history of Philip at the time of\\nhis death. As a writer of history, Mr. Prescott ranks with the first for\\naccuracy, precision, clearness, and beauty of style. As a man, he was\\ngenial, kind-hearted and even-tempered.\\n###\\n\\n\\nOn the whole, what I have seen raises my preconceived estimate of the\\nEnglish character. It is full of generous, true, and manly qualities; and\\nI doubt if there ever was so high a standard of morality in an aristocracy\\nwhich has such means for self-indulgence at its command, and which\\noccupies a position that secures it so much deference. In general, they do\\nnot seem to abuse their great advantages. The respect for religion--at\\nleast for the forms of it--is universal, and there are few, I imagine, of\\nthe great proprietors who are not more or less occupied with improving\\ntheir estates, and with providing for the comfort of their tenantry, while\\nmany take a leading part in the great political movements of the time.\\nThere never was an aristocracy which combined so much practical knowledge\\nand industry with the advantages of exalted rank.\\n\\nThe Englishman is seen to most advantage in his country home. For he is\\nconstitutionally both domestic and rural in his habits. His fireside and\\nhis farm--these are the places in which one sees his simple and warm-\\nhearted nature more freely unfolded. There is a shyness in an Englishman,\\n--a natural reserve, which makes him cold to strangers, and difficult to\\napproach. But once corner him in his own house, a frank and full expansion\\nwill be given to his feelings that we should look for in vain in the\\ncolder Yankee, and a depth not to be found in the light and superficial\\nFrenchman,--speaking of nationalities, not of individualities.\\n\\nThe Englishman is the most truly rural in his tastes and habits of any\\npeople in the world. I am speaking of the higher classes. The aristocracy\\nof other countries affect the camp and the city. But the English love\\ntheir old castles and country seats with a patriotic love. They are fond\\nof country sports. Every man shoots or hunts. No man is too old to be in\\nthe saddle some part of the day, and men of seventy years and more follow\\nthe hounds, and, take a five-barred gate at a leap. The women are good\\nwhips, are fond of horses and dogs, and other animals. Duchesses have\\ntheir cows, their poultry, their pigs,--all watched over and provided with\\naccommodations of Dutch-like neatness. All this is characteristic of the\\npeople. It may be thought to detract something from the feminine graces\\nwhich in other lands make a woman so amiably dependent as to be nearly\\nimbecile. But it produces a healthy and blooming race of women to match\\nthe hardy Englishman,--the finest development of the physical and moral\\nnature which the world has witnessed. For we are not to look on the\\nEnglish gentleman as a mere Nimrod. With all his relish for field sports\\nand country usages, he has his house filled with collections of art and\\nwith extensive libraries. The tables of the drawing-rooms are covered with\\nthe latest works, sent down by the London publisher. Every guest is\\nprovided with an apparatus for writing, and often a little library of\\nbooks for his own amusement. The English country gentleman of the present\\nday is anything but a Squire Western, though he does retain all his relish\\nfor field sports.\\n\\nThe character of an Englishman, under its most refined aspect, has some\\ndisagreeable points which jar unpleasantly on the foreigner not accustomed\\nto them. The consciousness of national superiority, combined with natural\\nfeelings of independence, gives him an air of arrogance, though it must be\\nowned that this is never betrayed in his own house,--I may almost say in\\nhis own country. But abroad, when he seems to institute a comparison\\nbetween himself and the people he is thrown with, it becomes so obvious\\nthat he is the most unpopular, not to say odious, person in the world.\\nEven the open hand with which he dispenses his bounty will not atone for\\nthe violence he offers to national vanity.\\n\\nThere are other defects, which are visible even in his most favored\\ncircumstances. Such is his bigotry, surpassing everything in a quiet\\npassive form, that has been witnessed since the more active bigotry of the\\ntimes of the Spanish Philips. Such, too, is the exclusive, limited range\\nof his knowledge and conceptions of all political and social topics and\\nrelations. The Englishman, the cultivated Englishman, has no standard of\\nexcellence borrowed from mankind. His speculation never travels beyond his\\nown little--great little--island. That is the world to him. True, he\\ntravels, shoots lions among the Hottentots, chases the grizzly bear over\\nthe Rocky Mountains, kills elephants in India and salmon on the coast of\\nLabrador, comes home, and very likely makes a book. But the scope of his\\nideas does not seem to be enlarged by all this. The body travels, not the\\nmind. And, however he may abuse his own land, he returns home as hearty a\\nJohn Bull, with all his prejudices and national tastes as rooted, as\\nbefore. The English--the men of fortune--all travel. Yet how little\\nsympathy they show for other people or institutions, and how slight is the\\ninterest they take in them! They are islanders, cut off from the great\\nworld. But their island is, indeed, a world of its own. With all their\\nfaults, never has the sun shone--if one may use the expression in\\nreference to England--all a more noble race, or one that has done more for\\nthe great interests of humanity.\\n\\nNOTES.--Nimrod is spoken of in Genesis (x. 9) as \"a mighty hunter.\" Thus\\nthe name came to be applied to any one devoted to hunting.\\n\\nSquire Western is a character in Fielding\\'s \"Tom Jones.\" He is represented\\nas an ignorant, prejudiced, irascible, but, withal, a jolly, good-humored\\nEnglish country gentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXIX.

A HOT DAY IN NEW YORK. (292)\\n\\nWilliam Dean Howells, 1837--, was born in Belmont County. Ohio. In boyhood\\nhe learned the printer\\'s trade, at which he worked for several years. He\\npublished a volume of poems in 1860, in connection with John J. Piatt.\\nFrom 1861 to 1865 he was United States Consul at Venice. On his return he\\nresided for a time in New York City, and was one of the editors of the\\n\"Nation.\" In 1871 he was appointed editor in chief of the \"Atlantic\\nMonthly.\" He held the position ten years, and then retired in order to\\ndevote himself to his own writings. Since then, he has been connected with\\nother literary magazines. Mr. Howells has written several books: novels\\nand sketches: his writings are marked by an artistic finish, and a keen\\nbut subtile humor. The following selection is an extract from \"Their\\nWedding Journey.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nWhen they alighted, they took their way up through one of the streets of\\nthe great wholesale businesses, to Broadway. On this street was a throng\\nof trucks and wagons, lading and unlading; bales and boxes rose and sank\\nby pulleys overhead; the footway was a labyrinth of packages of every\\nshape and size; there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that moved\\nall forward, no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it, save in the reeking\\nfaces of its helpless instruments.\\n\\nIt was four o\\'clock, the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day. The\\nspiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it, as if filled\\nwith the gloom of low-hovering wings. One half the street lay in shadow,\\nand one half in sun; but the sunshine itself was dim, as if a heat greater\\nthan its own had smitten it with languor. Little gusts of sick, warm wind\\nblew across the great avenue at the corners of the intersecting streets.\\nIn the upward distance, at which the journeyers looked, the loftier roofs\\nand steeples lifted themselves dim out of the livid atmosphere, and far up\\nand down the length of the street swept a stream of tormented life.\\n\\nAll sorts of wheeled things thronged it, conspicuous among which rolled\\nand jarred the gaudily painted stages, with quivering horses driven each\\nby a man who sat in the shade of a branching, white umbrella, and suffered\\nwith a moody truculence of aspect, and as if he harbored the bitterness of\\ndeath in his heart for the crowding passengers within, when one of them\\npulled the strap about his legs, and summoned him to halt.\\n\\nMost of the foot passengers kept to the shady side, and to the\\nunaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at\\nany other time, though there were fewer women among them. Indomitably\\nresolute of soul, they held their course with the swift pace of custom,\\nand only here and there they showed the effect of the heat.\\n\\nOne man, collarless, with waistcoat unbuttoned, and hat set far back from\\nhis forehead, waved a fan before his death-white, flabby face, and set\\ndown one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist.\\nAnother, as they passed him, was saying huskily to the friend at his side,\\n\"I can\\'t stand this much longer. My hands tingle as if they had gone to\\nsleep; my heart--\" But still the multitude hurried on, passing, repassing,\\nencountering, evading, vanishing into shop doors, and emerging from them,\\ndispersing down the side streets, and swarming out of them.\\n\\nIt was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination, and\\nin its effect of universal lunacy, it might well have seemed the last\\nphase of a world presently to be destroyed. They who were in it, but not\\nof it, as they fancied--though there was no reason for this--looked on it\\namazed, and at last their own errands being accomplished, and themselves\\nso far cured of the madness of purpose, they cried with one voice that it\\nwas a hideous sight, and strove to take refuge from it in the nearest\\nplace where the soda fountain sparkled.\\n\\nIt was a vain desire. At the front door of the apothecary\\'s hung a\\nthermometer, and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with a\\nmaniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind, \"Ninety-seven\\ndegrees!\" Behind them, at the door, there poured in a ceaseless stream of\\npeople, each pausing at the shrine of heat, before he tossed off the\\nhissing draught that two pale, close-clipped boys served them from either\\nside of the fountain. Then, in the order of their coming, they issued\\nthrough another door upon the side street, each, as he disappeared,\\nturning his face half round, and casting a casual glance upon a little\\ngroup near another counter.\\n\\nThe group was of a very patient, half-frightened, half-puzzled looking\\ngentleman who sat perfectly still on a stool, and of a lady who stood\\nbeside him, rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of pounded ice,\\nand easing one hand with the other when the first became tired. Basil\\ndrank his soda, and paused to look upon this group, which he felt would\\ncommend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently characteristic of the\\nlocal life, and, as \"The Sunstroke,\" would sell enormously in the hot\\nseason.\\n\\n\"Better take a little more of that,\" the apothecary said, looking up from\\nhis prescription, and, as the organized sympathy of the seemingly\\nindifferent crowd, smiling very kindly at his patient, who thereupon\\ntasted something in the glass he held.\\n\\n\"Do you still feel like fainting?\" asked the humane authority. \"Slightly,\\nnow and then,\" answered the other, \"but I\\'m hanging on hard to the bottom\\ncurve of that icicled S on your soda fountain, and I feel that I\\'m all\\nright as long as I can see that. The people get rather hazy occasionally,\\nand have no features to speak of. But I do n\\'t know that I look very\\nimpressive myself,\" he added in the jesting mood which seems the natural\\ncondition of Americans in the face of an embarrassments.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'ll do!\" the apothecary answered, with a laugh; but he said, in an\\nanswer to an anxious question from the lady, \"He mustn\\'t be moved for an\\nhour yet,\" and gayly pestled away at a prescription, while she resumed her\\noffice of grinding the pounded ice round and round upon her husband\\'s\\nskull. Isabel offered her the commiseration of friendly words, and of\\nlooks kinder yet, and then, seeing that they could do nothing, she and\\nBasil fell into the endless procession, and passed out of the side door.\\n\\n\"What a shocking thing,\" she whispered. \"Did you see how all the people\\nlooked, one after another, so indifferently at that couple, and evidently\\nforgot them the next instant? It was dreadful. I should n\\'t like to have\\nyou sun-struck in New York.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very considerate of you; but place for place, if any accident must\\nhappen to me among strangers, I think I should prefer to have it in New\\nYork. The biggest place is always the kindest as well as the cruelest\\nplace. Amongst the thousands of spectators the good Samaritan as well as\\nthe Levite would be sure to be. As for a sunstroke, it requires peculiar\\ngifts. But if you compel me to a choice in the matter, then I say give me\\nthe busiest part of Broadway for a sunstroke. There is such experience of\\ncalamity there that you could hardly fall the first victim to any\\nmisfortune.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXXI. DISCONTENT.--AN ALLEGORY. (295)\\n\\nJoseph Addison, 1672-1719, the brilliant essayist and poet, has long\\noccupied an exalted place in English literature. He was the son of an\\nEnglish clergyman, was born in Wiltshire, and educated at Oxford; he died\\nat \"Holland House\" (the property of his wile, to whom he had been married\\nbut about two years), and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Several years\\nof his life were spent in the political affairs of his time, he held\\nseveral public offices, and was, for ten years, a member of Parliament.\\nHis fame as an author rests chiefly upon his \"Hymns,\" his tragedy of\\n\"Cato,\" and his \"Essays\" contributed principally to the \"Tatler\" and the\\n\"Spectator.\" The excellent style of his essays, their genial wit and\\nsprightly humor, made them conspicuous in an age when coarseness,\\nbitterness, and exaggeration deformed the writings of the most eminent:\\nand these characteristics have given them an unquestioned place among the\\nclassics of our language.\\n\\nMr. Addison was shy and diffident, but genial and lovable; his moral\\ncharacter was above reproach, excepting that he is said to have been too\\nfond of wine.\\n###\\n\\n\\nIt is a celebrated thought of Socrates, that if all the misfortunes of\\nmankind were cast into a public stock, in order to be equally distributed\\namong the whole species, those who now think themselves the most unhappy,\\nwould prefer the share they are already possessed of before that which\\nwould fall to them by such a division. Horace has carried this thought a\\ngreat deal farther, and supposes that the hardships or misfortunes we lie\\nunder, are more easy to us than those of any other person would be, in\\ncase we could change conditions with him.\\n\\nAs I was ruminating on these two remarks, and seated in my elbowchair, I\\ninsensibly fell asleep; when, on a sudden, methought there was a\\nproclamation made by Jupiter, that every mortal should bring in his griefs\\nand calamities, and throw them together in a heap. There was a large plain\\nappointed for this purpose. I took my stand in the center of it, and saw,\\nwith a great deal of pleasure, the whole human species marching one after\\nanother, and throwing down their several loads, which immediately grew up\\ninto a prodigious mountain, that seemed to rise above the clouds.\\n\\nThere was a certain lady of a thin, airy shape, who was very active in\\nthis solemnity. She carried a magnifying glass in one of her hands, and\\nwas clothed in a loose, flowing robe, embroidered with several figures of\\nfiends and specters, that discovered themselves in a thousand chimerical\\nshapes as her garment hovered in the wind. There was something wild and\\ndistracted in her looks. Her name was Fancy. She led up every mortal to\\nthe appointed place, after having officiously assisted him in making up\\nhis pack, and laying it upon his shoulders. My heart melted within me to\\nsee my fellow-creatures groaning under their respective burdens, and to\\nconsider that prodigious bulk of human calamities which lay before me.\\n\\nThere were, however, several persons who gave me great diversion upon this\\noccasion. I observed one bringing in a  fardel, very carefully concealed\\nunder an old embroidered cloak, which, upon his throwing it into the heap,\\nI discovered to be poverty. Another, after a great deal of puffing, threw\\ndown his luggage, which, upon examining, I found to be his wife.\\n\\nThere were multitudes of lovers saddled with very whimsical burdens,\\ncomposed of darts and flames; but, what was very odd, though they sighed\\nas if their hearts would break under these bundles of calamities, they\\ncould not persuade themselves to cast them into the heap, when they came\\nup to it; but, after a few faint efforts, shook their heads, and marched\\naway as heavy loaden as they came.\\n\\nI saw multitudes of old women throw down their wrinkles, and several young\\nones who stripped themselves of a tawny skin. There were very great heaps\\nof red noses, large lips, and rusty teeth. The truth of it is, I was\\nsurprised to see the greatest part of the mountain made up of bodily\\ndeformities. Observing one advancing toward the heap with a larger cargo\\nthan ordinary upon his back, I found, upon his near approach, that it was\\nonly a natural hump, which he disposed of with great joy of heart among\\nthis collection of human miseries.\\n\\nThere were, likewise, distempers of all sorts, though I could not but\\nobserve that there were many more imaginary than real. One little packet I\\ncould not but take notice of, which was a complication of all the diseases\\nincident to human nature, and was in the hand of a great many fine people.\\nThis was called the spleen. But what most of all surprised me was, that\\nthere was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole heap: at which\\nI was very much astonished, having concluded within myself that everyone\\nwould take this opportunity of getting rid of his passions, prejudices,\\nand frailties.\\n\\nI took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow, who, I did not\\nquestion, came loaden with his crimes, but upon searching into his bundle,\\nI found that instead of throwing his guilt from him, he had only laid down\\nhis memory. He was followed by another worthless rogue, who flung away his\\nmodesty instead of his ignorance.\\n\\nWhen the whole race of mankind had thus cast their burdens, the phantom\\nwhich had been so busy on this occasion, seeing me an idle spectator of\\nwhat passed, approached toward me. I grew uneasy at her presence, when, of\\na sudden, she held her magnifying glass full before my eyes. I no sooner\\nsaw my face in it, but was startled at the shortness of it, which now\\nappeared to me in its utmost aggravation. The immoderate breadth of the\\nfeatures made me very much out of humor with my own countenance, upon\\nwhich I threw it from me like a mask. It happened very luckily that one\\nwho stood by me had just before thrown down his visage, which, it seems,\\nwas too long for him. It was, indeed, extended to a most shameful length;\\nI believe the very chin was, modestly speaking, as long as my whole face.\\nWe had both of us an opportunity of mending ourselves; and all the\\ncontributions being now brought in, every man was at liberty to exchange\\nhis misfortunes for those of another person.\\n\\nAs we stood round the heap, and surveyed the several materials of which it\\nwas composed, there was scarcely a mortal in this vast multitude who did\\nnot discover what he thought pleasures and blessings of life, and wondered\\nhow the owners of them ever came to look upon them as burthens and\\ngrievances. As we were regarding very attentively this confusion of\\nmiseries, this chaos of calamity, Jupiter issued out a second\\nproclamation, that everyone was now at liberty to exchange his affliction,\\nand to return to his habitation with any such other bundle as should be\\ndelivered to him. Upon this, Fancy began again to bestir herself, and,\\nparceling out the whole heap with incredible activity, recommended to\\neveryone his particular packet. The hurry and confusion at this time was\\nnot to be expressed. Some observations, which I made upon the occasion, I\\nshall communicate to the public.\\n\\nA venerable, gray-headed man, who had laid down the colic, and who, I\\nfound, wanted an heir to his estate, snatched up an undutiful son that had\\nbeen thrown into the heap by an angry father. The graceless youth, in less\\nthan a quarter of an hour, pulled the old gentleman by the beard, and had\\nliked to have knocked his brains out; so that meeting the true father, who\\ncame toward him with a fit of the gripes, he begged him to take his son\\nagain, and give him back his colic; but they were incapable, either of\\nthem, to recede from the choice they had made. A poor galley slave, who\\nhad thrown down his chains, took up the gout in their stead, but made such\\nwry faces that one might easily perceive he was no great gainer by the\\nbargain.\\n\\nThe female world were very busy among themselves in bartering for\\nfeatures; one was trucking a lock of gray hairs for a carbuncle; and\\nanother was making over a short waist for a pair of round shoulders; but\\non all these occasions there was not one of them who did not think the new\\nblemish, as soon as she had got it into her possession, much more\\ndisagreeable than the old one.\\n\\nI must not omit my own particular adventure. My friend with the long\\nvisage had no sooner taken upon him my short face, but he made such a\\ngrotesque figure in it, that as I looked upon him, I could not forbear\\nlaughing at myself, insomuch that I put my own face out of countenance.\\nThe poor gentleman was so sensible of the ridicule, that I found he was\\nashamed of what he had done. On the other side, I found that I myself had\\nno great reason to triumph, for as I went to touch my forehead, I missed\\nthe place, and clapped my finger upon my upper lip. Besides, as my nose\\nwas exceedingly prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks as I was\\nplaying my hand about my face, and aiming at some other part of it.\\n\\nI saw two other gentlemen by me who were in the same ridiculous\\ncircumstances. These had made a foolish swap between a couple of thick\\nbandy legs and two long trapsticks that had no calves to them. One of\\nthese looked like a man walking upon stilts, and was so lifted up into the\\nair, above his ordinary height, that his head turned round with it, while\\nthe other made such awkward circles, as he attempted to walk, that he\\nscarcely knew how to move forward upon his new supporters. Observing him\\nto be a pleasant kind of a fellow, I stuck my cane in the ground, and told\\nhim I would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up to it on a\\nline that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.\\n\\nThe heap was at last distributed among the two sexes, who made a most\\npiteous sight, as they wandered up and down under the pressure of their\\nseveral burthens. The whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints,\\ngroans and lamentations. Jupiter, at length taking compassion on the poor\\nmortals, ordered them a second time to lay down their loads, with a design\\nto give everyone his own again. They discharged themselves with a great\\ndeal of pleasure; after which, the phantom who had led them into such\\ngross delusions, was commanded to disappear. There was sent in her stead a\\ngoddess of a quite different figure: her motions were steady and composed,\\nand her aspect serious but cheerful. She every now and then cast her eyes\\ntoward heaven, and fixed them upon Jupiter. Her name was Patience. She had\\nno sooner placed herself by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very\\nremarkable, the whole heap sunk to such a degree that it did not appear a\\nthird part so big as it was before. She afterward returned every man his\\nown proper calamity, and, teaching him how to bear it in the most\\ncommodious manner, he marched off with it contentedly, being very well\\npleased that he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evil\\nwhich fell to his lot.\\n\\nBeside the several pieces of morality to be drawn out of this vision, I\\nlearnt from it never to repine at my own misfortunes, or to envy the\\nhappiness of another, since it is impossible for any man to form a right\\njudgment of his neighbor\\'s sufferings; for which reason, also, I have\\ndetermined never to think too lightly of another\\'s complaints, but to\\nregard the sorrows of my fellow-creatures with sentiments of humanity and\\ncompassion.\\n\\nNOTES.--Horace (b. 65, d. 8 B.

For\\nmany years he was partner in the well-known firm of Ticknor & Fields\\n(Later Fields, Osgood & Co.), the leading publishers of standard American\\nliterature. For eight years, he was chief editor of the \"Atlantic\\nMonthly;\" and, after he left that position, he often enriched its pages by\\nthe productions of his pen. During his latter years Mr. Fields gained some\\nreputation as a lecturer. His literary abilities were of no mean order:\\nbut he did not do so much in producing literature himself, as in aiding\\nothers in its production.\\n###\\n\\n\\nMrs. Chub was rich and portly,\\n  Mrs. Chub was very grand,\\nMrs. Chub was always reckoned\\n  A lady in the land.\\n\\nYou shall see her marble mansion\\n  In a very stately square,--\\nMr. C. knows what it cost him,\\n  But that\\'s neither here nor there.\\n\\nMrs. Chub was so sagacious,\\n  Such a patron of the arts,\\nAnd she gave such foreign orders\\n  That she won all foreign hearts.\\n\\nMrs. Chub was always talking,\\n  When she went away from home,\\nOf a most prodigious painting\\n  Which had just arrived from Rome.\\n\\n\"Such a treasure,\" she insisted,\\n  \"One might never see again!\"\\n\"What\\'s the subject?\" we inquired.\\n  \"It is Jupiter and Ten!\"\\n\\n\"Ten what?\" we blandly asked her\\n  For the knowledge we did lack,\\n\"Ah! that I can not tell you,\\n  But the name is on the back.\\n\\n\"There it stands in printed letters,--\\n  Come to-morrow, gentlemen,--\\nCome and see our splendid painting,\\n  Our fine Jupiter and Ten!\"\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Chub departed,\\n  Our brains began to rack,--\\nShe could not be mistaken\\n  For the name was on the back.\\n\\nSo we begged a great Professor\\n  To lay aside his pen,\\nAnd give some information\\n  Touching \"Jupiter and Ten.\"\\n\\nAnd we pondered well the subject,\\n  And our Lempriere we turned,\\nTo find out who the Ten were;\\n  But we could not, though we burned.\\n\\nBut when we saw the picture,--\\n  O Mrs. Chub!

SCENE FROM \"THE POOR GENTLEMAN.\"\\n\\nGeorge Colman, 1762-1836, was the son of George Colman, a writer of\\ndramas, who in 1777 purchased the \"Haymarket Theater,\" in London. Owing to\\nthe illness of the father, Colman the younger assumed the management of\\nthe theater in 1785, which post he held for a long time. He was highly\\ndistinguished as a dramatic author and wit. \"The Poor Gentleman,\" from\\nwhich the following selection is adapted, is perhaps the best known of his\\nworks.\\n###\\n\\n\\nSIR ROBERT BRAMBLE and HUMPHREY DOBBINS.\\n\\nSir R. I\\'ll tell you what, Humphrey Dobbins, there is not a syllable of\\nsense in all you have been saying. But I suppose you will maintain there\\nis.\\n\\nHum. Yes.\\n\\nSir R. Yes! Is that the way you talk to me, you old boor? What\\'s my name?\\n\\nHum. Robert Bramble.\\n\\nSir R. An\\'t I a baronet? Sir Robert Bramble, of Blackberry Hall, in the\\ncounty of Kent? \\'T is time you should know it, for you have been my\\nclumsy, two-fisted valet these thirty years: can you deny that?\\n\\nHum. Hem!\\n\\nSir R. Hem? What do you mean by hem? Open that rusty door of your mouth,\\nand make your ugly voice walk out of it. Why don\\'t you answer my question?\\n\\n\\nHum. Because, if I contradict you, I shall tell you a lie, and whenever I\\nagree with you, you are sure to fall out.\\n\\nSir R. Humphrey Dobbins. I have been so long endeavoring to beat a few\\nbrains into your pate that all your hair has tumbled off before my point\\nis carried.\\n\\nHum. What then? Our parson says my head is an emblem of both our honors.\\n\\nSir R. Ay; because honors, like your head, are apt to be empty.\\n\\nHum. No; but if a servant has grown bald under his master\\'s nose, it looks\\nas if there was honesty on one side, and regard for it on the other.\\n\\nSir R. Why, to be sure, old Humphrey, you are as honest as a--pshaw! the\\nparson means to palaver us; but, to return to my position, I tell you I do\\nn\\'t like your flat contradiction.\\n\\nHum. Yes, you do.\\n\\nSir R. I tell you I don\\'t. I only love to hear men\\'s arguments. I hate\\ntheir flummery.\\n\\nHum. What do you call flummery?\\n\\nSir R. Flattery, blockhead! a dish too often served up by paltry poor men\\nto paltry rich ones.\\n\\nHum. I never serve it up to you.\\n\\nSir R. No, you give me a dish of a different description.\\n\\nHum. Hem! what is it?\\n\\nSir R. Sauerkraut, you old crab\\n\\nHum. I have held you a stout tug at argument this many a year.\\n\\nSir R. And yet I could never teach you a syllogism. Now mind, when a poor\\nman assents to what a rich man says, I suspect he means to flatter him:\\nnow I am rich, and hate flattery. Ergo--when a poor man subscribes to my\\nopinion, I hate him.\\n\\nHum. That\\'s wrong.\\n\\nSir R. Very well; negatur; now prove it.\\n\\nHum. Put the case then, I am a poor man.\\n\\nSir R. You an\\'t, you scoundrel. You know you shall never want while I have\\na shilling.\\n\\nHum. Bless you!\\n\\nSir R. Pshaw! Proceed.\\n\\nHum. Well, then, I am a poor--I must be a poor man now, or I never shall\\nget on.\\n\\nSir R. Well, get on, be a poor man.\\n\\nHum. I am a poor man, and I argue with you, and convince you, you are\\nwrong; then you call yourself a blockhead, and I am of your opinion: now,\\nthat\\'s no flattery.\\n\\nSir R. Why, no; but when a man\\'s of the same opinion with me, he puts an\\nend to the argument, and that puts an end to the conversation, and so I\\nhate him for that. But where\\'s my nephew Frederic?\\n\\nHum. Been out these two hours.\\n\\nSir R. An undutiful cub! Only arrived from Russia last night, and though I\\ntold him to stay at home till I rose, he\\'s scampering over the fields like\\na Calmuck Tartar.\\n\\nHum. He\\'s a fine fellow.\\n\\nSir R. He has a touch of our family. Don\\'t you think he is a little like\\nme, Humphrey?\\n\\nHum. No, not a bit; you are as ugly an old man as ever I clapped my eyes\\non.\\n\\nSir R. Now that\\'s plaguy impudent, but there\\'s no flattery in it, and it\\nkeeps up the independence of argument. His father, my brother Job, is of\\nas tame a spirit--Humphrey, you remember my brother Job?\\n\\nHum. Yes, you drove him to Russia five and twenty years ago.\\n\\nSir R. I did not drive him.\\n\\nHum. Yes, you did. You would never let him be at peace in the way of\\nargument.\\n\\nSir R. At peace! Zounds, he would never go to war.\\n\\nHum. He had the merit to be calm.\\n\\nSir R. So has a duck pond. He was a bit of still life; a chip; weak water\\ngruel; a tame rabbit, boiled to rags, without sauce or salt. He received\\nmy arguments with his mouth open, like a poorbox gaping for half-pence,\\nand, good or bad, he swallowed them all without any resistance. We could\\nn\\'t disagree, and so we parted.\\n\\nHum. And the poor, meek gentleman went to Russia for a quiet life.\\n\\nSir R. A quiet life! Why, he married the moment he got there, tacked\\nhimself to the shrew relict of a Russian merchant, and continued a\\nspeculation with her in furs, flax, potashes, tallow, linen, and leather;\\nwhat\\'s the consequence? Thirteen months ago he broke.\\n\\nHum. Poor soul, his wife should have followed the business for him. Sir R.\\nI fancy she did follow it, for she died just as he broke, and now this\\nmadcap, Frederic, is sent over to me for protection. Poor Job, now he is\\nin distress, I must not neglect his son.\\n\\nHum. Here comes his son; that\\'s Mr. Frederic.\\n\\n   Enter FREDERIC.\\n\\nFred. Oh, my dear uncle, good morning! Your park is nothing but beauty.\\n\\nSir R. Who bid you caper over my beauty? I told you to stay in doors till\\nI got up.\\n\\nFred. So you did, but I entirely forgot it.\\n\\nSir R. And pray, what made you forget it?\\n\\nFred. The sun.\\n\\nSir R. The sun! he\\'s mad; you mean the moon, 1 believe.\\n\\nFred. Oh, my dear uncle, you don\\'t know the effect of a fine spring\\nmorning upon a fellow just arrived from Russia. The day looked bright,\\ntrees budding, birds singing, the park was so gay that I took a leap out\\nof your old balcony, made your deer fly before me like the wind, and\\nchased them all around the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while\\nyou were snoring in bed, uncle.\\n\\nSir R. Oh, oh! So the effect of English sunshine upon a Russian, is to\\nmake him jump out of a balcony, and worry my deer.\\n\\nFred. I confess it had that influence upon me.\\n\\nSir R. You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle, unless you think\\nthe sun likely to leave you a fat legacy.\\n\\nFred. I hate legacies.\\n\\nSir R. Sir, that\\'s mighty singular. They are pretty solid tokens, at\\nleast.\\n\\nFred. Very melancholy tokens, uncle; they are the posthumous dispatches\\nAffection sends to Gratitude, to inform us we have lost a gracious friend.\\n\\nSir R. How charmingly the dog argues!\\n\\nFred. But I own my spirits ran away with me this morning. I will obey you\\nbetter in future; for they tell me you are a very worthy, good sort of old\\ngentleman.\\n\\nSir R. Now who had the familiar impudence to tell you that? Fred. Old\\nrusty, there.\\n\\nSir R. Why Humphrey, you didn\\'t?\\n\\nHum. Yes, but I did though.\\n\\nFred, Yes, he did, and on that score I shall be anxious to show you\\nobedience, for \\'t is as meritorious to attempt sharing a good man\\'s heart,\\nas it is paltry to have designs upon a rich man\\'s money. A noble nature\\naims its attentions full breast high, uncle; a mean mind levels its dirty\\nassiduities at the pocket.\\n\\nSir R. (Shaking him by the hand.) Jump out of every window I have in my\\nhouse; hunt my deer into high fevers, my fine fellow! Ay, that\\'s right.\\nThis is spunk, and plain speaking. Give me a man who is always flinging\\nhis dissent to my doctrines smack in my teeth.\\n\\nFred. I disagree with you there, uncle.\\n\\nHum. And so do I.\\n\\nFred. You! you forward puppy! If you were not so old, I\\'d knock you down.\\n\\nSir R. I\\'ll knock you down, if you do. I won\\'t have my servants thumped\\ninto dumb flattery.\\n\\nHum. Come, you are ruffled. Let us go to the business of the morning.\\n\\nSir R. I hate the business of the morning. Don\\'t you see we are engaged in\\ndiscussion. I tell you, I hate the business of the morning.\\n\\nHum. No you don\\'t.\\n\\nSir R. Don\\'t I? Why not?\\n\\nHum. Because \\'t is charity.\\n\\nSir R. Pshaw! Well, we must not neglect the business, if there be any\\ndistress in the parish. Read the list, Humphrey.\\n\\nHum. (Taking out a paper and reading.) \"Jonathan Huggins, of Muck Mead, is\\nput in prison for debt.\"\\n\\nSir R. Why, it was only last week that Gripe, the attorney, recovered two\\ncottages for him by law, worth sixty pounds.\\n\\nHum. Yes, and charged a hundred for his trouble; so seized the cottages\\nfor part of his bill, and threw Jonathan into jail for the remainder.\\n\\nSir R. A harpy! I must relieve the poor fellow\\'s distress.\\n\\nFred. And I must kick his attorney.\\n\\nHum. (Reading.) \"The curate\\'s horse is dead.\"\\n\\nSir R. Pshaw! There\\'s no distress in that.\\n\\nHum. Yes, there is, to a man that must go twenty miles every Sunday to\\npreach three sermons, for thirty pounds a year.\\n\\nSir R. Why won\\'t the vicar give him another nag?\\n\\nHum. Because \\'t is cheaper to get another curate ready mounted.\\n\\nSir R. Well, send him the black pad which I purchased last Tuesday, and\\ntell him to work him as long as he lives. What else have we upon the list?\\n\\nHum. Something out of the common; there\\'s one Lieutenant Worthington, a\\ndisabled officer and a widower, come to lodge at Farmer Harrowby\\'s, in the\\nvillage; he is, it seems, very poor, and more proud than poor, and more\\nhonest than proud.\\n\\nSir R. And so he sends to me for assistance? Hum. He\\'d see you hanged\\nfirst! No, he\\'d sooner die than ask you or any man for a shilling! There\\'s\\nhis daughter, and his wife\\'s aunt, and an old corporal that served in the\\nwars with him, he keeps them all upon his half pay.\\n\\nSir R. Starves them all, I\\'m afraid, Humphrey.\\n\\nFred. (Going.) Good morning, uncle.\\n\\nSir R. You rogue, where are you running now?\\n\\nFred. To talk with Lieutenant Worthington.\\n\\nSir R. And what may you be going to say to him?\\n\\nFred. I can\\'t tell till I encounter him; and then, uncle, when I have an\\nold gentleman by the hand, who has been disabled in his country\\'s service,\\nand is struggling to support his motherless child, a poor relation, and a\\nfaithful servant, in honorable indigence, impulse will supply me with\\nwords to express my sentiments.\\n\\nSir R. Stop, you rogue; I must be before you in this business.\\n\\nFred. That depends on who can run the fastest; so, start fair, uncle, and\\nhere goes.--(Runs out.)\\n\\nSir R. Stop, stop; why, Frederic--a jackanapes--to take my department out\\nof my hands! I\\'ll disinherit the dog for his assurance.\\n\\nHum. No, you won\\'t.\\n\\nSir R. Won\\'t I? Hang me if I--but we\\'ll argue that point as we go. So,\\ncome along Humphrey.\\n\\nNOTES.-Ergo (pro. er\\'go) is a Latin word meaning therefore.

(310)\\n\\nWilliam Cowper, 1731-1800, was the son of an English clergyman; both his\\nparents were descended from noble families. He was always of a gentle,\\ntimid disposition; and the roughness of his schoolfellows increased his\\nweakness in this respect. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar, but\\nnever practiced his profession. When he was about thirty years of age, he\\nwas appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords, but could not summon\\ncourage to enter upon the discharge of its duties. He was so disturbed by\\nthis affair that he became insane, sought to destroy himself, and had to\\nbe consigned to a private asylum. Soon after his recovery, he found a\\ncongenial home in the family of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of this\\ngentleman, a few years later, he continued to reside with his widow till\\nher death, a short time before that of Cowper. Most of this time their\\nhome was at Olney. His first writings were published in 1782. He wrote\\nseveral beautiful hymns, \"The Task,\" and some minor poems. These, with his\\ntranslations of Homer and his correspondence, make up his published works.\\nHis life was always pure and gentle; he took great pleasure in simple,\\nnatural objects, and in playing with animals. His insanity returned from\\ntime to time, and darkened his life at its close. When six years of age,\\nhe lost his mother; and the following selection is part of a touching\\ntribute to her memory, written many years later.\\n###\\n\\n\\nOh that those lips had language! Life has passed\\nWith me but roughly since I heard them last.\\nMy mother, when I learned that thou wast dead,\\nSay, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?\\nHovered thy spirit o\\'er thy sorrowing son,\\nWretch even then, life\\'s journey just begun?\\nPerhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss,\\nPerhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss.\\nAh, that maternal smile! it answers--Yes!\\n\\nI heard the bell tolled on thy burial day;\\nI saw the hearse that bore thee slow away;\\nAnd, turning from my nursery window, drew\\nA long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!\\nBut was it such? It was. Where thou art gone,\\nAdieus and farewells are a sound unknown.\\nMay I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,\\nThe parting word shall pass my lips no more.\\n\\nThy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,\\nOft gave me promise of thy quick return;\\nWhat ardently I wished, I long believed;\\nAnd, disappointed still, was still deceived;\\nBy expectation, every day beguiled,\\nDupe of to-morrow, even when a child.\\nThus many a sad to-morrow came and went,\\nTill, all my stock of infant sorrows spent,\\nI learned at last submission to my lot;\\nBut, though I less deplored thee, ne\\'er forgot.\\n\\nMy boast is not that I deduce my birth\\nFrom loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;\\nBut higher far my proud pretensions rise,--\\nThe son of parents passed into the skies.\\nAnd now, farewell!   Time, unrevoked, has run\\nHis wonted course, yet what I wished is done.\\n\\nBy Contemplation\\'s help, not sought in vain,\\nI seem to have lived my childhood o\\'er again;\\nTo have renewed the joys that once were mine,\\nWithout the sin of violating thine;\\nAnd, while the wings of Fancy still are free,\\nAnd I can view this mimic show of thee,\\nTime has but half succeeded in his theft,--\\nThyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXXV. DEATH OF SAMSON. (312)\\n\\nJohn Milton, 1608-1674, was born in London--eight years before the\\ngreatest English poet, Shakespeare, died. His father followed the\\nprofession of a scrivener, in which he acquired a competence. As a boy,\\nMilton was exceedingly studious, continuing his studies till midnight. He\\ngraduated at Christ\\'s College, Cambridge, where his singular beauty, his\\nslight figure, and his fastidious morality caused his companions to\\nnickname him \"the lady of Christ\\'s.\" On leaving college he spent five\\nyears more in study, and produced his lighter poems. He then traveled on\\nthe continent, returning about the time the civil war broke out. For a time\\nhe taught a private school, but soon threw himself with all the power of\\nhis able and tried pen into the political struggle. He was the champion of\\nParliament and of Cromwell for about twenty years. On the accession of\\nCharles II., he concealed himself for a time, but was soon allowed to live\\nquietly in London. His eyesight had totally failed in 1654; but now, in\\nblindness, age, family affliction, and comparative poverty, he produced\\nhis great work \"Paradise Lost.\" In 1667 he sold the poem for 5 Pounds in\\ncash, with a promise of 10 Pounds more on certain contingencies; the sum\\ntotal received by himself and family for the immortal poem, was 23 Pounds.\\nLater, he produced \"Paradise Regained\" and \"Samson Agonistes,\" from the\\nlatter of which the following extract is taken. Milton is a wonderful\\nexample of a man, who, by the greatness of his own mind, triumphed over\\ntrials, afflictions, hardships, and the evil influence of bitter political\\ncontroversy.\\n###\\n\\nOccasions drew me early to this city;\\nAnd, as the gates I entered with sunrise,\\nThe morning trumpets festival proclaimed\\nThrough each high street: little I had dispatched,\\nWhen all abroad was rumored that this day\\nSamson should be brought forth, to show the people\\nProof of his mighty strength in feats and games.\\nI sorrowed at his captive state,\\nBut minded not to be absent at that spectacle.\\n\\nThe building was a spacious theater\\nHalf-round, on two main pillars vaulted high,\\nWith seats where all the lords, and each degree\\nOf sort, might sit in order to behold;\\nThe other side was open, where the throng\\nOn banks and scaffolds under sky might stand:\\nI among these aloof obscurely stood.\\nThe feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice\\nHad filled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,\\nWhen to their sports they turned. Immediately\\nWas Samson as a public servant brought,\\nIn their state livery clad: before him pipes\\nAnd timbrels; on each side went arme\\'d guards;\\nBoth horse and foot before him and behind,\\nArchers and slingers, cataphracts, and spears.\\nAt sight of him the people with a shout\\nRifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,\\nWho had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.\\n\\nHe, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,\\nCame to the place; and what was set before him,\\nWhich without help of eye might be essayed,\\nTo heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed\\nAll with incredible, stupendous force,\\nNone daring to appear antagonist.\\n\\nAt length for intermission sake, they led him\\nBetween the pillars; he his guide requested,\\nAs overtired, to let him lean awhile\\nWith both his arms on those two massy pillars,\\nThat to the arche\\'d roof gave main support.\\n\\nHe unsuspicious led him; which when Samson\\nFelt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,\\nAnd eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,\\nOr some great matter in his mind revolved:\\nAt last, with head erect, thus cried aloud:--\\n\"Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed\\nI have performed, as reason was, obeying,\\nNot without wonder or delight beheld;\\nNow, of my own accord, such other trial\\nI mean to show you of my strength yet greater,\\nAs with amaze shall strike all who behold.\"\\n\\nThis uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed;\\nAs with the force of winds and waters pent\\nWhen mountains tremble, those two massy pillars\\nWith horrible convulsion to and fro\\nHe tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew\\nThe whole roof after them with burst of thunder\\nUpon the heads of all who sat beneath,--\\nLords, ladies, captains, counselors, or priests,\\nTheir choice nobility and flower, not only\\nOf this, but each Philistian city round,\\nMet from all parts to solemnize this feast.\\nSamson, with these immixed, inevitably\\nPulled down the same destruction on himself;\\nThe vulgar only \\'scaped who stood without.\\n\\nNOTE.--The person supposed to be speaking is a Hebrew who chanced to be\\npresent at Gaza when the, incidents related took place. After the\\ncatastrophe he rushes to Manoah, the father of Samson, to whom and his\\nassembled friends he relates what he saw. (Cf. Bible, Judges xvi, 23.)\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXXVI.  AN EVENING ADVENTURE. (315)\\n\\nNot long since, a gentleman was traveling in one of the counties of\\nVirginia, and about the close of the day stopped at a public house to\\nobtain refreshment and spend the night. He had been there but a short\\ntime, before an old man alighted from his gig, with the apparent intention\\nof becoming his fellow guest at the same house.\\n\\nAs the old man drove up, he observed that both the shafts of his gig were\\nbroken, and that they were held together by withes, formed from the bark\\nof a hickory sapling. Our traveler observed further that he was plainly\\nclad, that his knee buckles were loosened, and that something like\\nnegligence pervaded his dress. Conceiving him to be one of the honest\\nyeomanry of our land, the courtesies of strangers passed between them, and\\nthey entered the tavern. It was about the same time, that an addition of\\nthree or four young gentlemen was made to their number; most, if not all\\nof them, of the legal profession.\\n\\nAs soon as they became conveniently accommodated, the conversation was\\nturned, by one of the latter, upon the eloquent harangue which had that\\nday been displayed at the bar. It was replied by the other that he had\\nwitnessed, the same day, a degree of eloquence no doubt equal, but it was\\nfrom the pulpit. Something like a sarcastic rejoinder was made as to the\\neloquence of the pulpit, and a warm and able altercation ensued, in which\\nthe merits of the Christian religion became the subject of discussion.\\nFrom six o\\'clock until eleven, the young champions wielded the sword of\\nargument, adducing with ingenuity and ability everything that could be\\nsaid pro and con.\\n\\nDuring this protracted period, the old gentleman listened with the\\nmeekness and modesty of a child, as if he were adding new information to\\nthe stores of his own mind; or perhaps he was observing, with a\\nphilosophic eye, the faculties of the youthful mind, and how new energies\\nare evolved by repeated action; or perhaps, with patriotic emotion, he was\\nreflecting upon the future destinies of his country, and on the rising\\ngeneration, upon whom those future destinies must devolve; or, most\\nprobably, with a sentiment of moral and religious feeling, he was\\ncollecting an argument which no art would be \"able to elude, and no force\\nto resist.\" Our traveler remained a spectator, and took no part in what\\nwas said.\\n\\nAt last one of the young men, remarking that it was impossible to combat\\nwith long and established prejudices, wheeled around, and with some\\nfamiliarity exclaimed, \"Well, my old gentleman, what think you of these\\nthings?\" \"If,\" said the traveler, \"a streak of vivid lightning had at that\\nmoment crossed the room, their amazement could not have been greater than\\nit was from what followed.\" The most eloquent and unanswerable appeal that\\nhe had ever heard or read, was made for nearly an hour by the old\\ngentleman. So perfect was his recollection, that every argument urged\\nagainst the Christian religion was met in the order in which it was\\nadvanced. Hume\\'s sophistry on the subject of miracles, was, if possible,\\nmore perfectly answered than it had already been done by Campbell. And in\\nthe whole lecture there was so much simplicity and energy, pathos and\\nsublimity, that not another word was uttered.\\n\\n\"An attempt to describe it,\" said the traveler, \"would be an attempt to\\npaint the sunbeams.\" It was now a matter of curiosity and inquiry who the\\nold gentleman was. The traveler concluded that it was the preacher from\\nwhom the pulpit eloquence was heard; but no, it was John Marshall, the\\nChief Justice of the United States.\\n\\nNOTES.--David Hume (b. 1711, d. 1776) was a celebrated Scotch historian\\nand essayist. His most important work is \"The History of England.\" He was\\na skeptic in matters of religion, and was a peculiarly subtle writer.\\n\\nGeorge Campbell (b. 1719, d. 1796) was a distinguished Scotch minister. He\\nwrote \"A Dissertation on Miracles,\" ably answering Hume\\'s \"Essay on\\nMiracles.\"\\n\\nJohn Marshall (b. 1755, d. 1835) was Chief Justice of the United States\\nfrom 1801 until his death. He was an eminent jurist, and wrote a \"Life of\\nWashington,\" which made him famous as an author.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXXVII. THE BAREFOOT BOY. (317)\\n\\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier, 1807-1892, was born in Haverhill, Mass., and,\\nwith short intervals of absence, he always resided in that vicinity. His\\nparents were Friends or \"Quakers,\" and he always held to the same faith.\\nHe spent his boyhood on a farm, occasionally writing verses for the papers\\neven then. Two years of study in the academy seem to have given him all\\nthe special opportunity for education that he ever enjoyed. In 1829 he\\nedited a newspaper in Boston, and the next year assumed a similar position\\nin Hartford. For two years he was a member of the Massachusetts\\nlegislature. In 1836 he edited an anti-slavery paper in Philadelphia, and\\nwas secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Mr. Whittier wrote\\nextensively both in prose and verse. During the later years of his life he\\npublished several volumes of poems, and contributed frequently to the\\npages of the \"Atlantic Monthly.\" An earnest opponent of slavery, some of\\nhis poems bearing on that subject are fiery and even bitter; but, in\\ngeneral, their sentiment is gentle, and often pathetic. As a poet, he took\\nrank among those most highly esteemed by his countrymen. \"Snow-Bound,\"\\npublished in 1805, is one of the longest and best of his poems. Several of\\nhis shorter pieces are marked by much smoothness and sweetness.\\n###\\n\\n\\nBlessings on thee, little man,\\nBarefoot boy, with cheek of tan!\\nWith thy turned-up pantaloons,\\nAnd thy merry whistled tunes;\\nWith thy red lip, redder still\\nKissed by strawberries on the hill;\\nWith the sunshine on thy face,\\nThrough thy torn brim\\'s jaunty grace;\\nFrom my heart I give thee joy,--\\nI was once a barefoot boy!\\nPrince thou art,--the grown-up man\\nOnly is republican.\\nLet the million-dollared ride!\\nBarefoot, trudging, at his side,\\nThou hast more than he can buy\\nIn the reach of ear and eye,--\\nOutward sunshine, inward joy:\\nBlessings on thee, barefoot boy!\\n\\nOh for boyhood\\'s painless play,\\nSleep that wakes in laughing day,\\nHealth that mocks the doctor\\'s rules,\\nKnowledge never learned of schools,\\nOf the wild bee\\'s morning chase,\\nOf the wild flower\\'s time and place,\\nFlight of fowl and habitude\\nOf the tenants of the wood;\\nHow the tortoise bears his shell,\\nHow the woodchuck digs his cell,\\nAnd the ground mole sinks his well\\nHow the robin feeds her young,\\nHow the oriole\\'s nest is hung;\\nWhere the whitest lilies blow,\\nWhere the freshest berries grow,\\nWhere the groundnut trails its vine,\\nWhere the wood grape\\'s clusters shine;\\nOf the black wasp\\'s cunning way,\\nMason of his walls of clay,\\nAnd the architectural plans\\nOf gray hornet artisans!--\\nFor, eschewing books and tasks,\\nNature answers all he asks;\\nHand in hand with her he walks,\\nFace to face with her he talks,\\nPart and parcel of her joy,--\\nBlessings on thee, barefoot boy!\\n\\nOh for boyhood\\'s time of June,\\nCrowding years in one brief moon,\\nWhen all things I heard or saw\\nMe, their master, waited for.\\nI was rich in flowers and trees,\\nHumming birds and honeybees;\\nFor my sport the squirrel played,\\nPlied the snouted mole his spade;\\nFor my taste the blackberry cone\\nPurpled over hedge and stone;\\nLaughed the brook for my delight\\nThrough the day and through the night,\\nWhispering at the garden wall,\\nTalked with me from fall to fall;\\nMine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,\\nMine the walnut slopes beyond,\\nMine, on bending orchard trees,\\nApples of Hesperides!\\nStill, as my horizon grew,\\nLarger grew my riches too;\\nAll the world I saw or knew\\nSeemed a complex Chinese toy,\\nFashioned for a barefoot boy!\\n\\nOh for festal dainties spread,\\nLike my bowl of milk and bread,--\\nPewter spoon and bowl of wood,\\nOn the doorstone, gray and rude!\\nO\\'er me, like a regal tent,\\nCloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,\\nPurple-curtained, fringed with gold,\\nLooped in many a wind-swung fold;\\nWhile for music came the play\\nOf the pied frog\\'s orchestra;\\nAnd to light the noisy choir,\\nLit the fly his lamp of fire.\\nI was monarch: pomp and joy\\nWaited on the barefoot boy!\\n\\nCheerily, then, my little man,\\nLive and laugh, as boyhood can!\\nThough the flinty slopes be hard,\\nStubble-speared the new-mown sward,\\nEvery morn shall lead thee through\\nFresh baptisms of the dew;\\nEvery evening from thy feet\\nShall the cool wind kiss the heat:\\nAll too soon these feet must hide\\nIn the prison cells of pride,\\nLose the freedom of the sod,\\nLike a colt\\'s for work be shod,\\nMade to tread the mills of toil,\\nUp and down in ceaseless moil:\\nHappy if their track be found\\nNever on forbidden ground;\\nHappy if they sink not in\\nQuick and treacherous sands of sin.\\nAh! that thou shouldst know thy joy\\nEre it passes, barefoot boy!\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The Hesperides, in Grecian mythology, were four sisters (some\\ntraditions say three, and others, seven) who guarded the golden apples\\ngiven to Juno as a wedding present.

Leigh Hunt, as he is commonly called,\\nwas prominent before the public for fifty years as \"a writer of essays,\\npoems, plays, novels, and criticisms.\" He was born at Southgate,\\nMiddlesex, England. His mother was an American lady. He began to write for\\nthe public at a very early age. In 1808, In connection with his brother,\\nhe established \"The Examiner,\" a newspaper advocating liberal opinions in\\npolitics. For certain articles offensive to the government, the brothers\\nwere fined 500 Pounds each and condemned to two years\\' imprisonment. Leigh\\nfitted up his prison like a boudoir, received his friends here, and wrote\\nseveral works during his confinement. Mr. Hunt was intimate with Byron,\\nShelley, Moore, and Keats, and was associated with Byron and Shelley in\\nthe publication of a political and literary journal. His last years were\\npeacefully devoted to literature, and in 1847 he received a pension from\\nthe government.\\n###\\n\\nKing Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,\\nAnd one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;\\nThe nobles filled the benches round, the ladies by their side,\\nAnd \\'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed:\\nAnd truly \\'t was a gallant thing to see that crowning show,\\nValor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.\\n\\nRamped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;\\nThey bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;\\nWith wallowing might and stifled roar, they rolled on one another:\\nTill all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thunderous smother;\\nThe bloody foam above the bars came whizzing through the air:\\nSaid Francis, then, \"Faith, gentlemen, we\\'re better here than there.\"\\n\\nDe Lorge\\'s love o\\'erheard the king,--a beauteous, lively dame,\\nWith smiling lips, and sharp, bright eyes, which always seemed the same;\\nShe thought, \"The Count, my lover, is brave as brave call be,\\nHe surely would do wondrous things to show his love for me;\\nKing, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;\\nI\\'ll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine.\"\\n\\nShe dropped her glove to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;\\nHe bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild;\\nThe leap was quick, return was quick, he soon regained his place,\\nThen threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady\\'s face.\\n\"In faith,\" cried Francis, \"rightly done!\" and he rose from where he sat;\\n\"No love,\" quoth he, \"but vanity, sets love a task like that.\"\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--King Francis. This is supposed to have been Francis I. of France\\n(b. 1494, d. 1547). He was devoted to sports of this nature.\\n\\n\\n\\nLXXXIX. THE FOLLY OF INTOXICATION. (322)\\n\\n\\nIago.    What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\\nCassio.  Ay, past all surgery.\\nIago.    Marry, heaven forbid!\\nCas.     Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have\\n         lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself,\\n         and what remains is bestial. My reputation! Iago, my reputation!\\n\\nIago.    As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some\\n         bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation.\\n         Reputation is an idle and most false imposition: oft got without\\n         merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at\\n         all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there\\n         are ways to recover the general again. Sue to him again, and he\\'s\\n         yours.\\n\\nCas.     I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a\\n         commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an\\n         officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear?\\n         and discourse fustian with one\\'s own shadow? O thou invisible\\n         spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call\\n         thee devil!\\n\\nIago.    What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he\\n         done to you?\\n\\nCas.     I know not.\\n\\nIago.    Is\\'t possible?\\n\\nCas.     I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel,\\n         but nothing wherefore. Oh that men should put an enemy in their\\n         mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy,\\n         revel, pleasure, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\\n\\nIago.    Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus\\n         recovered?\\n\\nCas.     It hath pleased the devil, Drunkenness, to give place to the\\n         devil, Wrath; one unperfectness shows me another, to make me\\n         frankly despise myself.\\n\\nIago.    Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and\\n         the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this\\n         had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own\\n         good.\\n\\nCas.     I will ask him for my place again: he shall tell me I am a\\n         drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would\\n         stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and\\n         presently a beast! Oh strange!--Every inordinate cup is\\n         unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil! Iago.  Come, come; good\\n         wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used; exclaim no\\n         more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love\\n         you.\\n\\nCas.     I have well approved it, sir,--I, drunk!\\n\\nIago.    You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I\\'ll tell you\\n         what you shall do. Our general\\'s wife is now the general. Confess\\n         yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your\\n         place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a\\n         disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more\\n         than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her\\n         husband, entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against any\\n         lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger\\n         than it was before.\\n\\nCas.     You advise me well.\\n\\nIago.    I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\\n\\nCas.     I think it freely, and betimes in the morning, I will beseech\\n         the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my\\n         fortunes if they check me here.\\n\\nIago.    You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\\n\\nCas.     Good night, honest Iago.\\n                                 Shakespeare.--Othello, Act ii, Scene iii.\\n\\nNOTES.--Iago is represented as a crafty, unscrupulous villain. He applies\\nfor the position of lieutenant under Othello, but the latter has already\\nappointed Cassio--who is honest, but of a weak character--to that\\nposition; he, however, makes Iago his ensign. Then Iago, to revenge\\nhimself for this and other fancied wrongs, enters upon a systematic course\\nof villainy, part of which is to bring about the intoxication of Cassio,\\nand his consequent discharge from the lieutenancy.\\n\\nThe Hydra was a fabled monster of Grecian mythology, having nine heads,\\none of which was immortal.\\n\\nDesdemona was the wife of Othello.\\n\\n\\n\\nXC. STARVED ROCK. (325)\\n\\nFrancis Parkman, 1823-1893, the son of a clergyman of the same name, was\\nborn in Boston, and graduated at Harvard University in 1844. He spent more\\nthan twenty years in a careful study of the early French explorations and\\nsettlements in America; and he published the fruits of his labor in twelve\\nlarge volumes. Although troubled with an affection of the eyes, which\\nsometimes wholly prevented reading or writing, his work was most carefully\\nand successfully done. His narratives are written in a clear and animated\\nstyle, and his volumes are a rich contribution to American history.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe cliff called \"Starved Rock,\" now pointed out to travelers as the chief\\nnatural curiosity of the region, rises, steep on three sides as a castle\\nwall, to the height of a hundred and twenty-five feet above the river. In\\nfront, it overhangs the water that washes its base; its western brow looks\\ndown on the tops of the forest trees below; and on the east lies a wide\\ngorge, or ravine, choked with the mingled foliage of oaks, walnuts, and\\nelms; while in its rocky depths a little brook creeps down to mingle with\\nthe river.\\n\\nFrom the rugged trunk of the stunted cedar that leans forward from the\\nbrink, you may drop a plummet into the river below, where the catfish and\\nthe turtles may plainly be seen gliding over the wrinkled sands of the\\nclear and shallow current. The cliff is accessible only from the south,\\nwhere a man may climb up, not without difficulty, by a steep and narrow\\npassage. The top is about an acre in extent.\\n\\nHere, in the month of December, 1682, La Salle and Tonty began to entrench\\nthemselves. They cut away the forest that crowned the rock, built\\nstorehouses and dwellings of its remains, dragged timber up the rugged\\npathway, and encircled the summit with a palisade. Thus the winter was\\npassed, and meanwhile the work of negotiation went prosperously on. The\\nminds of the Indians had been already prepared. In La Salle they saw their\\nchampion against the Iroquois, the standing terror of all this region.\\nThey gathered around his stronghold like the timorous peasantry of the\\nMiddle Ages around the rock-built castle of their feudal lord.\\n\\nFrom the wooden ramparts of St. Louis,--for so he named his fort,--high\\nand inaccessible as an eagle\\'s nest, a strange scene lay before his eye.\\nThe broad, flat valley of the Illinois was spread beneath him like a map,\\nbounded in the distance by its low wall of wooded hills. The river wound\\nat his feet in devious channels among islands bordered with lofty trees;\\nthen, far on the left, flowed calmly westward through the vast meadows,\\ntill its glimmering blue ribbon was lost in hazy distance.\\n\\nThere had been a time, and that not remote, when these fair meadows were a\\nwaste of death and desolation, scathed with fire, and strewn with the\\nghastly relics of an Iroquois victory. Now, all was changed. La Salle\\nlooked down from his rock on a concourse of wild human life. Lodges of\\nbark and rushes, or cabins of logs, were clustered on the open plain, or\\nalong the edges of the bordering forests. Squaws labored, warriors lounged\\nin the sun, naked children whooped and gamboled on the grass.\\n\\nBeyond the river, a mile and a half on the left, the banks were studded\\nonce more with the lodges of the Illinois, who, to the number of six\\nthousand, had returned, since their defeat, to this their favorite\\ndwelling place. Scattered along the valley, among the adjacent hills, or\\nover the neighboring prairie, were the cantonments of a half score of\\nother tribes, and fragments of tribes, gathered under the protecting aegis\\nof the French.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The curious elevation called Starved Rock is on the south side of\\nIllinois River, between La Salle and Ottawa. There is a legend according\\nto which it is said that over one hundred years ago, a party of Illinois\\nIndians took refuge here from the Pottawatomies; their besiegers, however,\\nconfined them so closely that the whole party perished of starvation, or,\\nas some say, of thirst. From this circumstance the rock takes its name.\\n\\nLa Salle (b. 1643, d. 1687) was a celebrated French explorer and fur\\ntrader. He established many forts throughout the Mississippi Valley,--\\namong them, Fort St. Louis, in 1683.\\n\\nTonty was an Italian, who formerly served in both the French army and\\nnavy, and afterwards joined La Salle in his explorations.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCI. PRINCE HENRY AND FALSTAFF. (327)\\n\\nPRINCE HENRY and POINS, in a back room, in a tavern.\\nEnter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO.\\n\\nPoins. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?\\n\\nFalstaff. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and\\namen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I\\'ll sew\\nnether stocks, and mend them, and foot them, too. A plague of all cowards!\\nGive me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant? (He drinks, and\\nthen continues.) You rogue, here\\'s lime in this sack, too; there is\\nnothing but roguery to be found in villainous man: yet a coward is worse\\nthan a cup of sack with lime in it. A villainous coward! Go thy ways, old\\nJack; die when thou wilt: if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the\\nface of the earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live not three good\\nmen unhanged, in England; and one of them is fat and grows old; a bad\\nworld, I say! I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms, or anything. A\\nplague of all cowards, I say still.\\n\\nPrince Henry. How now, woolsack?  What mutter you?\\n\\nFal. A king\\'s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger\\nof lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese,\\nI\\'ll never wear hair on my face more. You, Prince of Wales!\\n\\nP. Henry. Why, you baseborn dog! What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nFal. Are you not a coward? Answer me to that; and Poins there?\\n\\nPoins. Ye fat braggart, an ye call me coward, I\\'ll stab thee.\\n\\nFal. I call thee coward? I\\'ll see thee gibbeted ere I call thee coward:\\nbut I would give a thousand pounds I could run as fast as thou canst. You\\nare straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back:\\ncall you that backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing! Give me\\nthem that will face me. Give me a cup of sack. I am a rogue, if I have\\ndrunk to-day.\\n\\nP. Henry. O villain! thy lips ate scarce wiped since thou drunkest last.\\n\\nFal. All\\'s one for that. A plague of all cowards, still say 1. (He\\ndrinks.)\\n\\nP. Henry. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nFal. What\\'s the matter! There be four of us here have ta\\'en a thousand\\npounds this morning.\\n\\nP. Henry. Where is it, Jack? where is it?\\n\\nFal. Where is it? Taken from us it is; a hundred upon poor four of us.\\n\\nP. Henry. What! a hundred, man?\\n\\nFal. I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two\\nhours together. I have \\'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through\\nthe doublet; four, through the hose; my buckler cut through and through;\\nmy sword hacked like a handsaw; look here! (shows his sword.) I never\\ndealt better since I was a man; all would not do. A plague of all cowards!\\nLet them speak (pointing to GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO); if they speak\\nmore or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.\\n\\nP. Henry. Speak, sirs; how was it?\\n\\nGadshill. We four set upon some dozen--\\n\\nFal. Sixteen, at least, my lord.\\n\\nGad. And bound them.\\n\\nPeta. No, no, they were not bound.\\n\\nFal. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am a Jew,\\nelse--an Ebrew Jew.\\n\\nGad. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--\\n\\nFal. And unbound the rest; and then come in the other.\\n\\nP. Henry. What! fought ye with them all?\\n\\nFal. All? I know not what ye call all; but if I fought not with fifty of\\nthem, I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty\\nupon poor old Jack, then I am no two-legged creature.\\n\\nP. Henry. Pray heaven, you have not murdered some of them.\\n\\nFal. Nay, that\\'s past praying for; for I have peppered two of them; two I\\nam sure I have paid; two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal,\\nif I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, and call me a horse. Thou knowest\\nmy old ward; (he draws his sword and stands if about to fight) here I lay,\\nand thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--\\n\\nP. Henry. What! four? Thou saidst but two even now.\\n\\nFal. Four, Hal; I told thee four.\\n\\nPoins. Ay, ay, he said four.\\n\\nFal. These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made no more\\nado, but took all their seven points in my target, thus.\\n\\nP. Henry. Seven? Why, there were but four, even now.\\n\\nFal. In buckram?\\n\\nPoins. Ay, four, in buckram suits.\\n\\nFal. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.\\n\\nP. Henry. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.\\n\\nFal. Dost thou hear me, Hal?\\n\\nP. Henry. Ay, and mark thee, too, Jack.\\n\\nFal. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram, that\\nI told thee of--\\n\\nP. Henry. So, two more already.\\n\\nFal. Their points being broken, began to give me ground; but I followed me\\nclose, came in foot and hand; and, with a thought, seven of the eleven I\\npaid.\\n\\nP. Henry. O, monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!\\n\\nFal. But three knaves, in Kendal green, came at my back, and let drive at\\nme; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.\\n\\nP. Henry. These lies are like the father of them; gross as a mountain,\\nopen, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained, nott-pated fool; thou greasy\\ntallow keech--\\n\\nFal. What! Art thou mad! Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?\\n\\nP. Henry. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it\\nwas so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your reason; what\\nsayest thou to this?\\n\\nPoins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.\\n\\nFal. What, upon compulsion? No, were I at the strappado, or all the racks\\nin the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on\\ncompulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no\\nman a reason on compulsion, I.\\n\\nP. Henry. I\\'ll be no longer guilty of this sin: this sanguine coward, this\\nhorseback breaker, this huge hill of flesh--\\n\\nFal. Away! you starveling, you eel skin, you dried neat\\'s tongue, you\\nstockfish! Oh for breath to utter what is like thee!--you tailor\\'s yard,\\nyou sheath, you bow case, you--\\n\\nP. Henry. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou hast\\ntired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.\\n\\nPoins. Mark, Jack.\\n\\nP. Henry. We two saw you four set on four; you bound them, and were\\nmasters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.\\nThen did we two set on you four, and with a word outfaced you from your\\nprize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house.--And,\\nFalstaff, you carried yourself away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity,\\nand roared for mercy, and still ran and roared, as ever I heard a calf.\\nWhat a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say\\nit was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting hole, canst thou\\nnow find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?\\n\\nPoins. Come, let\\'s hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now?\\n\\nFal. Why, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, bear ye, my masters:\\nwas it for me to kill the heir apparent? Should I turn upon the true\\nprince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules; but beware\\ninstinct; the lion will not touch the true prince; instinct is a great\\nmatter; I was a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself and\\nthee during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince.\\nBut, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors. Watch\\nto-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold; all the\\ntitles of good-fellowship come to you! What! shall we be merry? Shall we\\nhave a play extempore?\\n\\nP. Henry. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.\\n\\nFal.

STUDIES. (332)\\n\\nSir Francis Bacon, 1561-1626. This eminent man was the youngest son of Sir\\nNicholas Bacon, lord keeper of the seal in the early part of Elizabeth\\'s\\nreign, and Anne Bacon, one of the most learned women of the time, daughter\\nof Sir Anthony Cooke. He was born in London, and educated at Cambridge. He\\nwas a laborious and successful student, but even in his boyhood conceived\\na great distrust of the methods of study pursued at the seats of\\nlearning,--methods which he exerted his great powers to correct in his\\nmaturer years. Much of his life was spent in the practice of law, in the\\ndischarge of the duties of high office, and as a member of Parliament;\\nbut, to the end of life, he busied himself with philosophical pursuits,\\nand he will be known to posterity chiefly for his deep and clear writings\\non these subjects. His constant direction in philosophy is to break away\\nfrom assumption and tradition, and to be led only by sound induction based\\non a knowledge of observed phenomena. His \"Novum Organum\" and \"Advancement\\nof Learning\" embody his ideas on philosophy and the true methods of\\nseeking knowledge.\\n\\nBacon rose to no very great distinction during the reign of Elizabeth;\\nbut, under James I, he was promoted to positions of great honor and\\ninfluence. In 1618 he was made Baron of Verulam; and, three years later,\\nhe was made Viscount of St. Albans. During much of his life, Bacon was in\\npecuniary straits, which was doubtless one reason of his downfall; for, in\\n1621, he was accused of taking bribes, a charge to which he pleaded\\nguilty. His disgrace followed, and he passed the last years of his life in\\nretirement. Among the distinguished names in English literature, none\\nstands higher in his department than that of Francis Bacon.\\n###\\n\\n\\nStudies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use\\nfor delight is in privateness, and retiring; for ornament, is in\\ndiscourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of\\nbusiness; for expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of the\\nparticulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and\\nmarshaling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.\\n\\nTo spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too much for\\nornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the\\nhumor of a scholar; they perfect nature and are perfected by experience--\\nfor natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by study;\\nand studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except\\nthey be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men\\nadmire them, and wise men use them, for they teach not their own use; but\\nthat is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation.\\n\\nRead not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted,\\nnor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some books are\\nto be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and\\ndigested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be\\nread, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with\\ndiligence and attention. Some books also may he read by deputy, and\\nextracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less\\nimportant arguments, and the meaner sort of books; else distilled books\\nare like common distilled waters, flashy things.\\n\\nReading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact\\nman; and, therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great\\nmemory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit; and if he\\nread little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth\\nnot. Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle;\\nnatural philosophy, deep; moral philosophy, grave; logic and rhetoric,\\nable to contend.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCIII. SURRENDER OF GRANADA. (334)\\n\\nSir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, 1806-1873, was born in Norfolk County,\\nEngland. His father died when he was young; his mother was a woman of\\nstrong literary tastes, and did much to form her son\\'s mind. In 1844, by\\nroyal license, he took the surname of Lytton from his mother\\'s family.\\nBulwer graduated at Cambridge. He began to publish in 1826, and his novels\\nand plays followed rapidly. \"Pelham,\" \"The Caxtons,\" \"My Novel,\" \"What\\nwill he do with it?\" and \"Kenelm  Chillingly\" are among the best known of\\nhis numerous novels; and \"The Lady of Lyons\" and \"Richelieu\" are his most\\nsuccessful plays. His novels are extensively read on the continent, and\\nhave been translated into most of the languages spoken there. \"Leila, or\\nthe Siege of Granada,\" from which this selection is adapted, was published\\nin 1840.\\n###\\n\\n\\nDay dawned upon Granada, and the beams of the winter sun, smiling away the\\nclouds of the past night, played cheerily on the murmuring waves of the\\nXenil and the Darro. Alone, upon a balcony commanding a view of the\\nbeautiful landscape, stood Boabdil, the last of the Moorish kings. He had\\nsought to bring to his aid all the lessons of the philosophy he had\\ncultivated.\\n\\n\"What are we,\" thought the musing prince, \"that we should fill the world\\nwith ourselves--we kings? Earth resounds with the crash of my falling\\nthrone; on the ear of races unborn the echo will live prolonged. But what\\nhave I lost? Nothing that was necessary to my happiness, my repose:\\nnothing save the source of all my wretchedness, the Marah of my life!\\nShall I less enjoy heaven and earth, or thought or action, or man\\'s more\\nmaterial luxuries of food or sleep--the common and the cheap desires of\\nall? Arouse thee, then, O heart within me! Many and deep emotions of\\nsorrow or of joy are yet left to break the monotony of existence. . . .\\nBut it is time to depart.\" So saying, he descended to the court, flung\\nhimself on his barb, and, with a small and saddened train, passed through\\nthe gate which we yet survey, by a blackened and crumbling tower,\\novergrown with vines and ivy; thence, amidst gardens now appertaining to\\nthe convent of the victor faith, he took his mournful and unwitnessed way.\\n\\nWhen he came to the middle of the hill that rises above those gardens, the\\nsteel of the Spanish armor gleamed upon him, as the detachment sent to\\noccupy the palace marched over the summit in steady order and profound\\nsilence. At the head of this vanguard, rode, upon a snow-white palfrey,\\nthe Bishop of Avila, followed by a long train of barefooted monks. They\\nhalted as Boabdil approached, and the grave bishop saluted him with the\\nair of one who addresses an infidel and inferior. With the quick sense of\\ndignity common to the great, and yet more to the fallen, Boabdil felt, but\\nresented not, the pride of the ecclesiastic. \"Go, Christian,\" said he,\\nmildly, \"the gates of the Alhambra are open, and Allah has bestowed the\\npalace and the city upon your king; may his virtues atone the faults of\\nBoabdil!\" So saying, and waiting no answer, he rode on without looking to\\nthe right or the left. The Spaniards also pursued their way.\\n\\nThe sun had fairly risen above the mountains, when Boabdil and his train\\nbeheld, from the eminence on which they were, the whole armament of Spain;\\nand at the same moment, louder than the tramp of horse or the clash of\\narms, was heard distinctly the solemn chant of Te Deum, which preceded the\\nblaze of the unfurled and lofty standards. Boabdil, himself still silent,\\nheard the groans and exclamations of his train; he turned to cheer or\\nchide them, and then saw, from his own watchtower, with the sun shining\\nfull upon its pure and dazzling surface, the silver cross of Spain. His\\nAlhambra was already in the hands of the foe; while beside that badge of\\nthe holy war waved the gay and flaunting flag of St. Iago, the canonized\\nMars of the chivalry of Spain. At that sight the King\\'s voice died within\\nhim; he gave the rein to his barb, impatient to close the fatal\\nceremonial, and did not slacken his speed till almost within bowshot of\\nthe first ranks of the army.\\n\\nNever had Christian war assumed a more splendid and imposing aspect. Far\\nas the eye could reach, extended the glittering and gorgeous lines of that\\ngoodly power, bristling with sunlit spears and blazoned banners; while\\nbeside, murmured, and glowed, and danced, the silver and laughing Xenil,\\ncareless what lord should possess, for his little day, the banks that\\nbloomed by its everlasting course. By a small mosque halted the flower of\\nthe army. Surrounded by the archpriests of that mighty hierarchy, the\\npeers and princes of a court that rivaled the Rolands of Charlemagne, was\\nseen the kingly form of Ferdinand himself, with Isabel at his right hand,\\nand the highborn dames of Spain, relieving, with their gay colors and\\nsparkling gems, the sterner splendor of the crested helmet and polished\\nmail. Within sight of the royal group, Boabdil halted, composed his aspect\\nso as best to conceal his soul, and, a little in advance of his scanty\\ntrain, but never in mien and majesty more a king, the son of Abdallah met\\nhis haughty conqueror.\\n\\nAt the sight of his princely countenance and golden hair, his comely and\\ncommanding beauty, made more touching by youth, a thrill of compassionate\\nadmiration ran through that assembly of the brave and fair. Ferdinand and\\nIsabel slowly advanced to meet their late rival,--their new subject; and,\\nas Boabdil would have dismounted, the Spanish king placed his hand upon\\nhis shoulder. \"Brother and prince,\" said he, \"forget thy sorrows; and may\\nour friendship hereafter console thee for reverses, against which thou\\nhast contended as a hero and a king--resisting man, but resigned at length\\nto God.\"\\n\\nBoabdil did not affect to return this bitter but unintentional mockery of\\ncompliment, He bowed his head, and remained a moment silent; then\\nmotioning to his train, four of his officers approached, and, kneeling\\nbeside Ferdinand, proffered to him, upon a silver buckler, the keys of the\\ncity. \"O king!\" then said Boabdil, \"accept the keys of the last hold which\\nhas resisted the arms of Spain! The empire of the Moslem is no more. Thine\\nare the city and the people of Granada; yielding to thy prowess, they yet\\nconfide in thy mercy.\" \"They do well,\" said the king; \"our promises shall\\nnot be broken. But since we know the gallantry of Moorish cavaliers, not\\nto us, but to gentler hands, shall the keys of Granada be surrendered.\"\\n\\nThus saying, Ferdinand gave the keys to Isabel, who would have addressed\\nsome soothing flatteries to Boabdil, but the emotion and excitement were\\ntoo much for her compassionate heart, heroine and queen though she was;\\nand when she lifted her eyes upon the calm and pale features of the\\nfallen monarch, the tears gushed from them irresistibly, and her voice\\ndied in murmurs. A faint flush overspread the features of Boabdil, and\\nthere was a momentary pause of embarrassment, which the Moor was the first\\nto break.\\n\\n\"Fair queen,\" said he, with mournful and pathetic dignity, \"thou canst\\nread the heart that thy generous sympathy touches and subdues; this is thy\\nlast, nor least glorious conquest. But I detain ye; let not my aspect\\ncloud your triumph. Suffer me to say farewell.\" \"Farewell, my brother,\"\\nreplied Ferdinand, \"and may fair fortune go with you! Forget the past!\"\\nBoabdil smiled bitterly, saluted the royal pair with profound and silent\\nreverence, and rode slowly on, leaving the army below as he ascended the\\npath that led to his new principality beyond the Alpuxarras. As the trees\\nsnatched the Moorish cavalcade from the view of the king, Ferdinand\\nordered the army to recommence its march; and trumpet and cymbal presently\\nsent their music to the ear of the Moslems.\\n\\nBoabdil spurred on at full speed, till his panting charger halted at the\\nlittle village where his mother, his slaves, and his faithful wife,\\nAmine--sent on before--awaited him. Joining these, he proceeded without\\ndelay upon his melancholy path. They ascended that eminence which is the\\npass into the Alpuxarras. From its height, the vale, the rivers, the\\nspires, and the towers of Granada broke gloriously upon the view of the\\nlittle band. They halted mechanically and abruptly; every eye was turned\\nto the beloved scene. The proud shame of baffled warriors, the tender\\nmemories of home, of childhood, of fatherland, swelled every heart, and\\ngushed from every eye.\\n\\nSuddenly the distant boom of artillery broke from the citadel, and rolled\\nalong the sunlit valley and crystal river. A universal wail burst from the\\nexiles; it smote,--it overpowered the heart of the ill-starred king, in\\nvain seeking to wrap himself in Eastern pride or stoical philosophy. The\\ntears gushed from his eyes, and he covered his face with his hands. The\\nband wound slowly on through the solitary defiles; and that place where\\nthe king wept is still called The Last Sigh of the Moor.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Granada was the capital of an ancient Moorish kingdom of the same\\nname, in the southeastern part of Spain.

GINEVRA. (340)\\n\\nSamuel Rogers, 1763-1855, was the son of a London banker, and, in company\\nwith his father, followed the banking business for some years. He began to\\nwrite at an early age, and published his \"Pleasures of Memory,\" perhaps\\nhis most famous work, in 1792. The next year his father died, leaving him\\nan ample fortune. He now retired from business and established himself in\\nan elegant house in St. James\\'s Place. This house was a place of resort\\nfor literary men during fifty years. In 1822 he published his longest\\npoem, \"Italy,\" after which he wrote but little. He wrote with care,\\nspending, as he said, nine years on the \"Pleasures of Memory,\" and sixteen\\non \"Italy.\" \"His writings are remarkable for elegance of diction, purity\\nof taste, and beauty of sentiment.\" It is said that he was very agreeable\\nin conversation and manners, and benevolent in his disposition; but he was\\naddicted to ill-nature and satire in some of his criticisms.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  If thou shouldst ever come by choice or chance\\nTo Modena,--where still religiously\\nAmong her ancient trophies, is preserved\\nBologna\\'s bucket (in its chain it hangs\\nWithin that reverend tower, the Guirlandine),--\\nStop at a palace near the Reggio gate,\\nDwelt in of old by one of the Orsini.\\nIts noble gardens, terrace above terrace,\\nAnd rich in fountains, statues, cypresses,\\nWill long detain thee; through their arche\\'d walks,\\nDim at noonday, discovering many a glimpse\\nOf knights and dames such as in old romance,\\nAnd lovers such as in heroic song,--\\nPerhaps the two, for groves were their delight,\\nThat in the springtime, as alone they sate,\\nVenturing together on a tale of love.\\nRead only part that day.--A summer sun\\nSets ere one half is seen; but, ere thou go,\\nEnter the house--prithee, forget it not--\\nAnd look awhile upon a picture there.\\n\\n  \\'T is of a lady in her earliest youth,\\nThe very last of that illustrious race,\\nDone by Zampieri--but by whom I care not.\\nHe who observes it, ere he passes on,\\nGazes his fill, and comes and comes again,\\nThat he may call it up when far away.\\n\\n  She sits, inclining forward as to speak,\\nHer lips half-open, and her finger up,\\nAs though she said, \"Beware!\" her vest of gold,\\nBroidered with flowers, and clasped from head to foot,\\nAn emerald stone in every golden clasp;\\nAnd on her brow, fairer than alabaster,\\nA coronet of pearls.

(344)\\n\\nJohn Caldwell Calhoun, 1782-1850. This great statesman, and champion of\\nsouthern rights and opinions, was born in Abbeville District, South\\nCarolina. In the line of both parents, he was of Irish Presbyterian\\ndescent. In youth he was very studious, and made the best use of such\\nopportunities for education as the frontier settlement afforded. He\\ngraduated at Yale College in 1804, and studied law at Litchfield,\\nConnecticut. In 1808 he was elected to the Legislature of South Carolina;\\nand, three years later, he was chosen to the National House of\\nRepresentatives. During the six years that he remained in the House, he\\ntook an active and prominent part in the stirring events of the time. In\\n1817 he was appointed Secretary of War, and held the office seven years.\\nFrom 1825 to 1832 he was Vice President of the United States. He then\\nresigned this office, and took his seat as senator from South Carolina. In\\n1844 President Tyler called him to his Cabinet as Secretary of State; and,\\nin 1845, he returned to the Senate, where he remained till his death.\\nDuring all his public life Mr. Calhoun was active and outspoken. His\\nearnestness and logical force commanded the respect of those who differed\\nmost widely from him in opinion. He took the most advanced ground in favor\\nof \"State Rights,\" and defended slavery as neither morally nor politically\\nwrong. His foes generally conceded his honesty, and respected his ability;\\nwhile his friends regarded him as little less than an oracle.\\n\\nIn private life Mr. Calhoun was highly esteemed and respected. His home\\nwas at \"Fort Hill,\" in the northwestern district of South Carolina; and\\nhere he spent all the time he could spare from his public duties, in the\\nenjoyments of domestic life and in cultivating his plantation. In his home\\nhe was remarkable for kindness, cheerfulness, and sociability.\\n###\\n\\n\\nTo comprehend more fully the force and bearing of public opinion, and to\\nform a just estimate of the changes to which, aided by the press, it will\\nprobably lead, politically and socially, it will be necessary to consider\\nit in connection with the causes that have given it an influence so great\\nas to entitle it to be regarded as a new political element. They will,\\nupon investigation, be found in the many discoveries and inventions made\\nin the last few centuries.\\n\\nAll these have led to important results. Through the invention of the\\nmariner\\'s compass, the globe has been circumnavigated and explored; and\\nall who inhabit it, with but few exceptions, are brought within the sphere\\nof an all-pervading commerce, which is daily diffusing over its surface\\nthe light and blessings of civilization.\\n\\nThrough that of the art of printing, the fruits of observation and\\nreflection, of discoveries and inventions, with all the accumulated stores\\nof previously acquired knowledge, are preserved and widely diffused. The\\napplication of gunpowder to the art of war has forever settled the long\\nconflict for ascendency between civilization and barbarism, in favor of\\nthe former, and thereby guaranteed that, whatever knowledge is now\\naccumulated, or may hereafter be added, shall never again be lost.\\n\\nThe numerous discoveries and inventions, chemical and mechanical, and the\\napplication of steam to machinery, have increased many fold the productive\\npowers of labor and capital, and have thereby greatly increased the number\\nwho may devote themselves to study and improvement, and the amount of\\nmeans necessary for commercial exchanges, especially between the more and\\nthe less advanced and civilized portions of the globe, to the great\\nadvantage of both, but particularly of the latter.\\n\\nThe application of steam to the purposes of travel and transportation, by\\nland and water, has vastly increased the facility, cheapness, and rapidity\\nof both: diffusing, with them, information and intelligence almost as\\nquickly and as freely as if borne by the winds; while the electrical wires\\noutstrip them in velocity, rivaling in rapidity even thought itself.\\n\\nThe joint effect of all this has been a great increase and diffusion of\\nknowledge; and, with this, an impulse to progress and civilization\\nheretofore unexampled in the history of the world, accompanied by a mental\\nenergy and activity unprecedented.\\n\\nTo all these causes, public opinion, and its organ, the press, owe their\\norigin and great influence. Already they have attained a force in the more\\ncivilized portions of the globe sufficient to be felt by all governments,\\neven the most absolute and despotic. But, as great as they now are, they\\nhave, as yet, attained nothing like their maximum force. It is probable\\nthat not one of the causes which have contributed to their formation and\\ninfluence, has yet produced its full effect; while several of the most\\npowerful have just begun to operate; and many others, probably of equal or\\neven greater force, yet remain to be brought to light.\\n\\nWhen the causes now in operation have produced their full effect, and\\ninventions and discoveries shall have been exhausted--if that may ever\\nbe--they will give a force to public opinion, and cause changes, political\\nand social, difficult to be anticipated. What will be their final bearing,\\ntime only can decide with any certainty.\\n\\nThat they will, however, greatly improve the condition of man ultimately,\\nit would be impious to doubt; it would be to suppose that the all-wise and\\nbeneficent Being, the Creator of all, had so constituted man as that the\\nemployment of the high intellectual faculties with which He has been\\npleased to endow him, in order that he might develop the laws that control\\nthe great agents of the material world, and make them subservient to his\\nuse, would prove to him the cause of permanent evil, and not of permanent\\ngood.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--This selection is an extract from \"A Disquisition on Government.\"\\nMr. Calhoun expected to revise his manuscript before it was printed, but\\ndeath interrupted his plans.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCVII. ENOCH ARDEN AT THE WINDOW. (347)\\n\\nAlfred Tennyson, 1809-1892, was born in Somerby, Lincolnshire, England;\\nhis father was a clergyman noted for his energy and physical stature.\\nAlfred, with his two older brothers, graduated at Trinity College,\\nCambridge. His first volume of poems appeared in 1830; it made little\\nimpression, and was severely treated by the critics. On the publication of\\nhis third series, in 1842, his poetic genius began to receive general\\nrecognition. On the death of Wordsworth he was made poet laureate, and he\\nwas then regarded as the foremost living poet of England. \"In Memoriam,\"\\nwritten in memory of his friend Arthur Hallam, appeared in 1850; the\\n\"Idyls of the King,\" in 1858; and \"Enoch Arden,\" a touching story in\\nverse, from which the following selection is taken, was published in 1864.\\nIn 1883 he accepted a peerage as Baron Tennyson of Aldworth, Sussex, and\\nof Freshwater, Isle of Wight.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  But Enoch yearned to see her face again;\\n\"If I might look on her sweet face again\\nAnd know that she is happy.\" So the thought\\nHaunted and harassed him, and drove him forth,\\nAt evening when the dull November day\\nWas growing duller twilight, to the hill.\\nThere he sat down gazing on all below;\\nThere did a thousand memories roll upon him,\\nUnspeakable for sadness. By and by\\nThe ruddy square of comfortable light,\\nFar-blazing from the rear of Philip\\'s house,\\nAllured him, as the beacon blaze allures\\nThe bird of passage, till he mildly strikes\\nAgainst it, and beats out his weary life.\\n\\n  For Philip\\'s dwelling fronted on the street,\\nThe latest house to landward; but behind,\\nWith one small gate that opened on the waste,\\nFlourished a little garden, square and walled:\\nAnd in it throve an ancient evergreen,\\nA yew tree, and all round it ran a walk\\nOf shingle, and a walk divided it:\\nBut Enoch shunned the middle walk, and stole\\nUp by the wall, behind the yew; and thence\\nThat which he better might have shunned, if griefs\\nLike his have worse or better, Enoch saw.\\n\\n  For cups and silver on the burnished board\\nSparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:\\nAnd on the right hand of the hearth he saw\\nPhilip, the slighted suitor of old times,\\nStout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;\\nAnd o\\'er her second father stooped a girl,\\nA later but a loftier Annie Lee,\\nFair-haired and tall, and from her lifted hand\\nDangled a length of ribbon and a ring\\nTo tempt the babe, who reared his creasy arms,\\nCaught at and ever missed it, and they laughed:\\nAnd on the left hand of the hearth he saw\\nThe mother glancing often toward her babe,\\nBut turning now and then to speak with him,\\nHer son, who stood beside her tall and strong,\\nAnd saying that which pleased him, for he smiled.\\n\\n  Now when the dead man come to life beheld\\nHis wife, his wife no more, and saw the babe,\\nHers, yet not his, upon the father\\'s knee,\\nAnd all the warmth, the peace, the happiness.\\nAnd his own children tall and beautiful,\\nAnd him, that other, reigning in his place,\\nLord of his rights and of his children\\'s love,\\nThen he, tho\\' Miriam Lane had told him all,\\nBecause things seen are mightier than things heard,\\nStaggered and shook, holding the branch, and feared\\nTo send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,\\nWhich in one moment, like the blast of doom,\\nWould shatter all the happiness of the hearth.\\n\\n  He, therefore, turning softly like a thief,\\nLest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,\\nAnd feeling all along the garden wall,\\nLest he should swoon and tumble and be found,\\nCrept to the gate, and opened it, and closed,\\nAs lightly as a sick man\\'s chamber door,\\nBehind him, and came out upon the waste.\\nAnd there he would have knelt but that his knees\\nWere feeble, so that falling prone he dug\\nHis fingers into the wet earth, and prayed.\\n\\n  \"Too hard to bear! why did they take me thence?\\nO God Almighty, blessed Savior, Thou\\nThat did\\'st uphold me on my lonely isle,\\nUphold me, Father, in my loneliness\\nA little longer! aid me, give me strength\\nNot to tell her, never to let her know.\\nHelp me not to break in upon her peace.\\nMy children too! must I not speak to these?\\nThey know me not. I should betray myself.\\nNever!--no father\\'s kiss for me!--the girl\\nSo like her mother, and the boy, my son!\"\\n\\n  There speech and thought and nature failed a little,\\nAnd he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced\\nBack toward his solitary home again,\\nAll down the long and narrow street he went\\nBeating it in upon his weary brain,\\nAs tho\\' it were the burden of a song,\\n\"Not to tell her, never to let her know.\"\\n\\nNOTE.--Enoch Arden had been wrecked on an uninhabited island, and was\\nsupposed to be dead. After many years he was rescued, and returned home,\\nwhere he found his wife happily married a second time. For her happiness,\\nhe kept his existence a secret, but soon died of a broken heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCVIII. LOCHINVAR. (350)\\n\\nOh, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,\\nThrough all the wide Border his steed was the best;\\nAnd save his good broadsword, he weapon had none,\\nHe rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone!\\nSo faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,\\nThere never was knight like the young Lochinvar!\\n\\nHe stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,\\nHe swam the Eske River where ford there was none;\\nBut ere he alighted at Netherby gate,\\nThe bride had consented, the gallant came late:\\nFor a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,\\nWas to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar!\\n\\nSo boldly he entered the Netherby hall,\\nAmong bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:\\nThen spoke the bride\\'s father, his hand on his sword--\\nFor the poor craven bridegroom said never a word--\\n\"Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,\\nOr to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?\"\\n\\n\"I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied;--\\nLove swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide--\\nAnd now am I come, with this lost love of mine,\\nTo lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.\\nThere are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,\\nThat would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.\"\\n\\nThe bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up,\\nHe quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.\\nShe looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,\\nWith a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.\\nHe took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,\\n\"Now tread we a measure!\" said young Lochinvar.\\n\\nSo stately his form, and so lovely her face,\\nThat never a hall such a galliard did grace;\\nWhile her mother did fret, and her father did fume,\\nAnd the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;\\nAnd the bridemaidens whispered, \"\\'Twere better by far\\nTo have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.\"\\n\\nOne touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,\\nWhen they reached the hall door, and the charger stood near,\\nSo light to the croup the fair lady he swung,\\nSo light to the saddle before her he sprung!\\n\"She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur:\\nThey\\'ll have fleet steeds that follow,\" quoth young Lochinvar.\\n\\nThere was mounting \\'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;\\nForsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran;\\nThere was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,\\nBut the lost bride of Netherby ne\\'er did they see.\\nSo daring in love, and so dauntless in war,\\nHave ye e\\'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?\\n                                                      -- Walter Scott.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The above selection is a song taken from Scott\\'s poem of\\n\"Marmion.\" It is in a slight degree founded on a ballad called \"Katharine\\nJanfarie,\" to be found in the \"Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.\"\\n\\nThe Solway Frith, on the southwest coast of Scotland, is remarkable for\\nits high spring tides.\\n\\nBonnet is the ordinary name in Scotland for a man\\'s cap.\\n\\n\\n\\nXCIX.  SPEECH ON THE TRIAL OF A MURDERER. (352)\\n\\nAgainst the prisoner at the bar, as an individual, I can not have the\\nslightest prejudice. I would not do him the smallest injury or injustice.\\nBut I do not affect to be indifferent to the discovery and the punishment\\nof this deep guilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium, how much soever\\nit may be, which is cast on those who feel and manifest an anxious concern\\nthat all who had a part in planning, or a hand in executing this deed of\\nmidnight assassination, may be brought to answer for their enormous crime\\nat the bar of public justice.\\n\\nThis is a most extraordinary case. In some respects it has hardly a\\nprecedent anywhere; certainly none in our New England history. This bloody\\ndrama exhibited no suddenly excited, ungovernable rage. The actors in it\\nwere not surprised by any lionlike temptation springing upon their virtue,\\nand overcoming it before resistance could begin. Nor did they do the deed\\nto glut savage vengeance, or satiate long-settled and deadly hate. It was\\na cool, calculating, money-making murder. It was all \"hire and salary, not\\nrevenge.\" It was the weighing of money against life; the counting out of\\nso many pieces of silver against so many ounces of blood.\\n\\nAn aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own house, and in his\\nown bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder for mere pay. Truly,\\nhere is a new lesson for painters and poets. Whoever shall hereafter draw\\nthe portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has been exhibited in an\\nexample, where such example was last to have been looked for, in the very\\nbosom of our New England society, let him not give it the grim visage of\\nMoloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the face black with settled hate, and\\nthe bloodshot eye emitting livid fires of malice. Let him draw, rather, a\\ndecorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a picture in repose, rather than\\nin action; not so much an example of human nature in its depravity, and in\\nits paroxysms of crime, as an infernal nature, a fiend in the ordinary\\ndisplay and development of his character.\\n\\nThe deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and steadiness\\nequal to the wickedness with which it was planned. The circumstances, now\\nclearly in evidence, spread out the whole scene before us. Deep sleep had\\nfallen on the destined victim, and on all beneath his roof. A healthful\\nold man, to whom sleep was sweet,--the first sound slumbers of the night\\nheld him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin enters through the\\nwindow, already prepared, into an unoccupied apartment. With noiseless\\nfoot he paces the lonely hall, half-lighted by the moon; he winds up the\\nascent of the stairs, and reaches the door of the chamber. Of this, he\\nmoves the lock by soft and continued pressure till it turns on its hinges\\nwithout noise; and he enters, and beholds his victim before him. The room\\nwas uncommonly open to the admission of light. The face of the innocent\\nsleeper was turned from the murderer, and the beams of the moon, resting\\non the gray locks of his aged temple, showed him where to strike. The\\nfatal blow is given! and the victim passes, without a struggle or a\\nmotion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of death!\\n\\nIt is the assassin\\'s purpose to make sure work; and he yet plies the\\ndagger, though it was obvious that life had been destroyed by the blow of\\nthe bludgeon. He even raises the aged arm, that he may not fail in his aim\\nat the heart; and replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard! To\\nfinish the picture, he explores the wrist for the pulse! He feels for it,\\nand ascertains that it beats no longer! It is accomplished. The deed is\\ndone. He retreats, retraces his steps to the window, passes out through it\\nas he came in, and escapes. He has done the murder; no eye has seen him,\\nno ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is safe!\\n\\nAh! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe\\nnowhere. The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where the\\nguilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which\\nglances through all disguises, and beholds everything as in the splendor\\nof noon; such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by men.\\nTrue it is, generally speaking, that \"murder will out.\" True it is that\\nProvidence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that those who\\nbreak the great law of Heaven by shedding man\\'s blood, seldom succeed in\\navoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so much attention as\\nthis, discovery must come, and wilt come, sooner or later. A thousand eyes\\nturn at once to explore every man, everything, every circumstance\\nconnected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch every whisper; a\\nthousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their\\nlight, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of\\ndiscovery.\\n\\nMeantime, the guilty soul can not keep its own secret. It is false to\\nitself, or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be\\ntrue to itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and knows not what\\nto do with it. The human heart was not made for the residence of such an\\ninhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares not\\nacknowledge to God nor man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no\\nsympathy or assistance either from heaven or earth. The secret which the\\nmurderer possesses soon comes to possess him; and, like the evil spirits\\nof which we read, it overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will.\\nHe feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding\\ndisclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his\\neyes, and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts.\\nIt has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his\\ncourage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions from without begin to\\nembarrass him, and the net of circumstance to entangle him, the fatal\\nsecret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth. It must be\\nconfessed, it will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession but\\nsuicide, and suicide is confession.\\n                                                       --Daniel Webster.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The above extract is from Daniel Webster\\'s argument in the trial of\\nJohn F. Knapp for the murder of Mr. White, a very wealthy and respectable\\ncitizen of Salem, Mass, Four persons were arrested as being concerned in\\nthe conspiracy; one confessed the plot and all the details of the crime,\\nimplicating the others, but he afterwards refused to testify in court. The\\nman who, by this confession, was the actual murderer, committed suicide,\\nand Mr. Webster\\'s assistance was obtained in prosecuting the others. John\\nF. Knapp was convicted as principal, and the other two as accessaries in\\nthe murder.\\n\\n\\n\\nC. THE CLOSING YEAR. (355)\\n\\nGeorge Denison Prentice, 1802-1870, widely known as a political writer, a\\npoet, and a wit, was born in Preston, Connecticut, and graduated at Brown\\nUniversity in 1823. He studied law, but never practiced his profession. He\\nedited a paper in Hartford for two years; and, in 1831, he became editor\\nof the \"Louisville Journal,\" which position he held for nearly forty\\nyears. As an editor, Mr. Prentice was an able, and sometimes bitter,\\npolitical partisan, abounding in wit and satire; as a poet, he not only\\nwrote gracefully himself, but he did much by his kindness and sympathy to\\ndevelop the poetical talents of others. Some who have since taken high\\nrank, first became known to the world through the columns of the\\n\"Louisville Journal.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\n\\'T is midnight\\'s holy hour, and silence now\\nIs brooding like a gentle spirit o\\'er\\nThe still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds,\\nThe bell\\'s deep notes are swelling; \\'t is the knell\\nOf the departed year.\\n\\n                       No funeral train\\nIs sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,\\nWith melancholy light, the moonbeams rest\\nLike a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred\\nAs by a mourner\\'s sigh; and, on yon cloud,\\nThat floats so still and placidly through heaven,\\nThe spirits of the Seasons seem to stand--\\nYoung Spring, bright Summer, Autumn\\'s solemn form,\\nAnd Winter, with his aged locks--and breathe\\nIn mournful cadences, that come abroad\\nLike the far wind harp\\'s wild and touching wail,\\nA melancholy dirge o\\'er the dead year,\\nGone from the earth forever.\\n\\n                             \\'Tis a time\\nFor memory and for tears. Within the deep,\\nStill chambers of the heart, a specter dim,\\nWhose tones are like the wizard voice of Time,\\nHeard from the tomb of ages, points its cold\\nAnd solemn finger to the beautiful\\nAnd holy visions, that have passed away,\\nAnd left no shadow of their loveliness\\nOn the dead waste of life. That specter lifts\\nThe coffin lid of Hope, and Joy, and Love,\\nAnd, bending mournfully above the pale,\\nSweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers\\nO\\'er what has passed to nothingness.\\n\\n                                     The year\\nHas gone, and, with it, many a glorious throng\\nOf happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,\\nIts shadow in each heart. In its swift course\\nIt waved its scepter o\\'er the beautiful,\\nAnd they are not. It laid its pallid hand\\nUpon the strong man; and the haughty form\\nIs fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.\\nIt trod the hall of revelry, where thronged\\nThe bright and joyous; and the tearful wail\\nOf stricken ones is heard, where erst the song\\nAnd reckless shout resounded. It passed o\\'er\\nThe battle plain, where sword, and spear, and shield\\nFlashed in the light of midday; and the strength\\nOf serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,\\nGreen from the soil of carnage, waves above\\nThe crushed and moldering skeleton. It came,\\nAnd faded like a wreath of mist at eve;\\nYet, ere it melted in the viewless air,\\nIt heralded its millions to their home\\nIn the dim land of dreams.\\n\\n                            Remorseless Time!--\\nFierce spirit of the glass and scythe!--what power\\nCan stay him in his silent course, or melt\\nHis iron heart to pity! On, still on\\nHe presses, and forever. The proud bird,\\nThe condor of the Andes, that can soar\\nThrough heaven\\'s unfathomable depths, or brave\\nThe fury of the northern hurricane,\\nAnd bathe his plumage in the thunder\\'s home,\\nFurls his broad wings at nightfall, and sinks down\\nTo rest upon his mountain crag; but Time\\nKnows not the weight of sleep or weariness;\\nAnd Night\\'s deep darkness has no chain to bind\\nHis rushing pinion.\\n\\n                    Revolutions sweep\\nO\\'er earth, like troubled visions o\\'er the breast\\nOf dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink\\nLike bubbles on the water; fiery isles\\nSpring blazing from the ocean, and go back\\nTo their mysterious caverns; mountains rear\\nTo heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow\\nTheir tall heads to the plain; new empires rise,\\nGathering the strength of hoary centuries,\\nAnd rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,\\nStartling the nations; and the very stars,\\nYon bright and burning blazonry of God,\\nGlitter awhile in their eternal depths,\\nAnd, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,\\nShoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away,\\nTo darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,\\nTime the tomb builder, holds his fierce career,\\nDark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not\\nAmid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,\\nTo sit and muse, like other conquerors,\\nUpon the fearful ruin he has wrought.\\n\\n\\n\\nCI. A NEW CITY IN COLORADO. (358)\\n\\nHelen Hunt Jackson, 1830-1885, was the daughter of the late Professor\\nNathan W. Fiske, of Amherst College. She was born in Amherst, and educated\\nat Ipswich, Massachusetts, and at New York. Mrs. Jackson was twice\\nmarried. In the latter years of her life, she became deeply interested in\\nthe Indians, and wrote two books, \"Ramona,\" a novel, and \"A Century of\\nDishonor,\" setting forth vividly the wrongs to which the red race has been\\nsubjected. She had previously published several books of prose and poetry,\\nless important but charming in their way. The following selection is\\nadapted from \"Bits of Travel at Home.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nGarland City is six miles from Fort Garland. The road to it from the fort\\nlies for the last three miles on the top of a sage-grown plateau. It is\\nstraight as an arrow, looks in the distance like a brown furrow on the\\npale gray plain, and seems to pierce the mountains beyond. Up to within an\\neighth of a mile of Garland City, there is no trace of human habitation.\\nKnowing that the city must be near, you look in all directions for a\\nglimpse of it; the hills ahead of you rise sharply across your way. Where\\nis the city? At your very feet, but you do not suspect it.\\n\\nThe sunset light was fading when we reached the edge of the ravine in\\nwhich the city lies. It was like looking unawares over the edge of a\\nprecipice; the gulch opened beneath us as suddenly as if the earth had\\nthat moment parted and made it. With brakes set firm, we drove cautiously\\ndown the steep road; the ravine twinkled with lights, and almost seemed to\\nflutter with white tents and wagon tops. At the farther end it widened,\\nopening out on an inlet of the San Luis Park; and, in its center, near\\nthis widening mouth, lay the twelve-days-old city. A strange din arose\\nfrom it.\\n\\n\"What is going on?\" we exclaimed. \"The building of the city,\" was the\\nreply. \"Twelve days ago there was not a house here. To-day there are one\\nhundred and five, and in a week more there will be two hundred; each man\\nis building his own home, and working day and night to get it done ahead\\nof his neighbor. There are four sawmills going constantly, but they can\\'t\\nturn out lumber half fast enough. Everybody has to be content with a board\\nat a time. If it were not for that, there would have been twice as many\\nhouses done as there are.\"\\n\\nWe drove on down the ravine. A little creek on our right was half hid in\\nwillow thickets. Hundreds of white tents gleamed among them: tents with\\npoles; tents made by spreading sailcloth over the tops of bushes; round\\ntents; square tents; big tents; little tents; and for every tent a camp\\nfire; hundreds of white-topped wagons, also, at rest for the night, their\\ngreat poles propped up by sticks, and their mules and drivers lying and\\nstanding in picturesque groups around them.\\n\\nIt was a scene not to be forgotten. Louder and louder sounded the chorus\\nof the hammers as we drew near the center of the \"city;\" more and more the\\nbustle thickened; great ox teams swaying unwieldily about, drawing logs\\nand planks, backing up steep places; all sorts of vehicles driving at\\nreckless speed up and down; men carrying doors; men walking along inside\\nof window sashes,--the easiest way to carry them; men shoveling; men\\nwheeling wheelbarrows; not a man standing still; not a man with empty\\nhands; every man picking up something, and running to put it down\\nsomewhere else, as in a play; and, all the while, \"Clink! clink! clink!\"\\nringing above the other sounds,--the strokes of hundreds of hammers, like\\nthe \"Anvil Chorus.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Perry\\'s Hotel?\" we asked. One of the least busy of the throng\\nspared time to point to it with his thumb, as he passed us. In some\\nbewilderment we drew up in front of a large unfinished house, through the\\nmany uncased apertures of which we could see only scaffoldings, rough\\nboards, carpenters\\' benches, and heaps of shavings. Streams of men were\\npassing in and out through these openings, which might be either doors or\\nwindows; no steps led to any of them.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! oh, yes! can accommodate you all!\" was the landlord\\'s reply to\\nour hesitating inquiries. He stood in the doorway of his dining-room; the\\nstreams of men we had seen going in and out were the fed and the unfed\\nguests of the house. It was supper time; we also were hungry. We peered\\ninto the dining room: three tables full of men; a huge pile of beds on the\\nfloor, covered with hats and coats; a singular wall, made entirely of\\ndoors propped upright; a triangular space walled off by sailcloth,--this\\nis what we saw. We stood outside, waiting among the scaffolding and\\nbenches. A black man was lighting the candles in a candelabrum made of two\\nnarrow bars of wood nailed across each other at right angles, and\\nperforated with holes. The candles sputtered, and the hot fat fell on the\\nshavings below.\\n\\n\"Dangerous way of lighting a room full of shavings,\" some one said. The\\nlandlord looked up at the swinging candelabra and laughed. \"Tried it\\npretty often,\" he said. \"Never burned a house down yet.\"\\n\\nI observed one peculiarity in the speech at Garland City. Personal\\npronouns, as a rule, were omitted; there was no time for a superfluous\\nword.\\n\\n\"Took down this house at Wagon Creek,\" he continued, \"just one week ago;\\ntook it down one morning while the people were eating breakfast; took it\\ndown over their heads; putting it up again over their heads now.\"\\n\\nThis was literally true. The last part of it we ourselves were seeing\\nwhile he spoke, and a friend at our elbow had seen the Wagon Creek crisis.\\n\\n\\n\"Waiting for that round table for you,\" said the landlord; \" \\'ll bring the\\nchairs out here\\'s fast\\'s they quit \\'em. That\\'s the only way to get the\\ntable.\"\\n\\nSo, watching his chances, as fast as a seat was vacated, he sprang into\\nthe room, seized the chair and brought it out to us; and we sat there in\\nour \"reserved seats,\" biding the time when there should be room enough\\nvacant at the table for us to take our places.\\n\\nWhat an indescribable scene it was! The strange-looking wall of propped\\ndoors which we had seen, was the impromptu, wall separating the bedrooms\\nfrom the dining-room. Bedrooms? Yes, five of them; that is, five\\nbedsteads in a row, with just space enough between them to hang up a\\nsheet, and with just room enough between them and the propped doors for a\\nmoderate-sized person to stand upright if he faced either the doors or the\\nbed. Chairs? Oh, no! What do you want of a chair in a bedroom which has a\\nbed in it? Washstands? One tin basin out in the unfinished room. Towels?\\nUncertain.\\n\\nThe little triangular space walled off by the sailcloth was a sixth\\nbedroom, quite private and exclusive; and the big pile of beds on the\\ndining-room floor was to be made up into seven bedrooms more between the\\ntables, after everybody had finished supper.\\n\\nLuckily for us we found a friend here,--a man who has been from the\\nbeginning one of Colorado\\'s chief pioneers; and who is never, even in the\\nwildest wilderness, without resources of comfort.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t sleep here,\" he said. \"I can do better for you than this.\"\\n\\n\"Better!\"\\n\\nHe offered us luxury. How movable a thing is one\\'s standard of comfort! A\\ntwo-roomed pine shanty, board walls, board floors, board ceilings, board\\npartitions not reaching to the roof, looked to us that night like a\\npalace. To have been entertained at Windsor Castle would not have made us\\nhalf so grateful.\\n\\nIt was late before the \"city\" grew quiet; and, long after most of the\\nlights were out, and most of the sounds had ceased, I heard one solitary\\nhammer in the distance, clink, clink, clink. I fell asleep listening to\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\nCII. IMPORTANCE OF THE UNION. (362)\\n\\nMr. President: I am conscious of having detained you and the Senate much\\ntoo long. I was drawn into the debate with no previous deliberation, such\\nas is suited to the discussion of so grave and important a subject. But it\\nis a subject of which my heart is full, and I have not been willing to\\nsuppress the utterance of its spontaneous sentiments. I can not, even now,\\npersuade myself to relinquish it, without expressing once more my deep\\nconviction, that, since it respects nothing less than the union of the\\nstates, it is of most vital and essential importance to the public\\nhappiness.\\n\\nI profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily in view the\\nprosperity and honor of the whole country, and the preservation of our\\nfederal Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety at home, and our\\nconsideration and dignity abroad. It is to that Union that we are chiefly\\nindebted for whatever makes us most proud of our country. That Union we\\nreached only by the discipline of our virtues, in the severe school of\\nadversity. It had its origin in the necessities of disordered finance,\\nprostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its benign influences, these\\ngreat interests immediately awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with\\nnewness of life. Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs\\nof its utility and its blessings; and, although our territory has\\nstretched out wider and wider, and our population spread farther and\\nfarther, they have not outrun its protection or its benefits. It has been\\nto us all a copious fountain of national, social, and personal happiness.\\n\\nI have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what\\nmight lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed the\\nchances of preserving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together shall\\nbe broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the precipice\\nof disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth\\nof the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe counselor in the\\naffairs of this government, whose thoughts should be mainly bent on\\nconsidering, not how the Union should be best preserved, but how tolerable\\nmight be the condition of the people when it shall be broken up and\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nWhile the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects spread\\nout before us, for us and our children. Beyond that, I seek not to\\npenetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at least, that curtain may\\nnot rise. God grant that on my vision never may be opened what lies\\nbehind. When my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun\\nin heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored\\nfragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered, discordant,\\nbelligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in\\nfraternal blood.\\n\\nLet their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous\\nensign of the Republic, now known and honored throughout the earth, still\\nfull high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their original\\nluster, not a stripe erased or polluted, not a single star\\nobscured--bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as, What\\nis all this worth? nor those other words of delusion and folly, Liberty\\nfirst, and Union afterwards--but everywhere, spread all over in characters\\nof living light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they float over the\\nsea and over the land, and in every wind under the whole heavens, that\\nother sentiment, dear to every true American heart--Liberty and Union, now\\nand forever, one and inseparable!\\n                                                        --Daniel Webster.\\n\\nNOTE.--This selection is the peroration of Mr. Webster\\'s speech in reply\\nto Mr. Hayne during the debate in the Senate on Mr. Foot\\'s Resolution in\\nregard to the Public Lands.\\n\\n\\n\\nCIII. THE INFLUENCES OF THE SUN. (364)\\n\\nJohn Tyndall, 1820-1893, one of the most celebrated modern\\nscientists, was an Irishman by birth. He was a pupil of the distinguished\\nFaraday. In 1853 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy in the\\nRoyal Institution of London. He is known chiefly for his brilliant\\nexperiments and clear writing respecting heat, light, and sound. He also\\nwrote one or two interesting books concerning the Alps and their glaciers.\\nHe visited America, and delighted the most intelligent audiences by his\\nscientific lectures and his brilliant experiments. The scientific world is\\nindebted to him for several remarkable discoveries.\\n###\\n\\n\\nAs surely as the force which moves a clock\\'s hands is derived from the arm\\nwhich winds up the clock, so surely is all terrestrial power drawn from\\nthe sun. Leaving out of account the eruptions of volcanoes, and the ebb\\nand flow of the tides, every mechanical action on the earth\\'s surface,\\nevery manifestation of power, organic and inorganic, vital and physical,\\nis produced by the sun. His warmth keeps the sea liquid, and the\\natmosphere a gas, and all the storms which agitate both are blown by the\\nmechanical force of the sun. He lifts the rivers and the glaciers up to\\nthe mountains; and thus the cataract and the avalanche shoot with an\\nenergy derived immediately from him.\\n\\nThunder and lightning are also his transmitted strength. Every fire that\\nburns and every flame that glows, dispenses light and heat which\\noriginally belonged to the sun. In these days, unhappily, the news of\\nbattle is familiar to us, but every shock and every charge is an\\napplication or misapplication of the mechanical force of the sun. He blows\\nthe trumpet, he urges the projectile, he bursts the bomb. And, remember,\\nthis is not poetry, but rigid mechanical truth.\\n\\nHe rears, as I have said, the whole vegetable world, and through it the\\nanimal; the lilies of the field are his workmanship, the verdure of the\\nmeadows, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. He forms the muscles, he\\nurges the blood, he builds the brain. His fleetness is in the lion\\'s foot;\\nhe springs in the panther, he soars in the eagle, he slides in the snake.\\nHe builds the forest and hews it down, the power which raised the tree,\\nand which wields the ax, being one and the same. The clover sprouts and\\nblossoms, and the scythe of the mower swings, by the operation of the same\\nforce.\\n\\nThe sun digs the ore from our mines, he rolls the iron; he rivets the\\nplates, he boils the water; he draws the train. He not only grows the\\ncotton, but he spins the fiber and weaves the web. There is not a hammer\\nraised, a wheel turned, or a shuttle thrown, that is not raised, and\\nturned, and thrown by the sun.\\n\\nHis energy is poured freely into space, but our world is a halting place\\nwhere this energy is conditioned. Here the Proteus works his spells; the\\nselfsame essence takes a million shapes and hues, and finally dissolves\\ninto its primitive and almost formless form. The sun comes to us as heat;\\nhe quits us as heat; and between his entrance and departure the multiform\\npowers of our globe appear. They are all special forms of solar power--the\\nmolds into which his strength is temporarily poured in passing from its\\nsource through infinitude.\\n\\nNOTE.--Proteus (pro. Pro\\'te-us) was a mythological divinity. His\\ndistinguishing characteristic was the power of assuming different shapes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCIV. COLLOQUIAL POWERS OF FRANKLIN. (366)\\n\\nWilliam Wirt, 1772-1834, an American lawyer and author, was born at\\nBladensburg, Maryland. Left an orphan at an early age, he was placed in\\ncare of his uncle. He improved his opportunities for education so well\\nthat he became a private tutor at fifteen. In 1792 he was admitted to the\\nbar, and began the practice of law in Virginia; he removed to Richmond in\\n1799. From 1817 to 1829 he was Attorney-general of the United States. His\\nlast years were spent in Baltimore. Mr. Wirt was the author of several\\nbooks; his \"Letters of a British Spy,\" published in 1803, and \"Life of\\nPatrick Henry,\" published in 1817, are the best known of his writings.\\n###\\n\\n\\nNever have I known such a fireside companion. Great as he was both as a\\nstatesman and philosopher, he never shone in a light more winning than\\nwhen he was seen in a domestic circle. It was once my good fortune to pass\\ntwo or three weeks with him, at the house of a private gentleman, in the\\nback part of Pennsylvania, and we were confined to the house during the\\nwhole of that time by the unintermitting constancy and depth of the snows.\\nBut confinement never could be felt where Franklin was an inmate; His\\ncheerfulness and his colloquial powers spread around him a perpetual\\nspring.\\n\\nWhen I speak, however, of his colloquial powers, I do not mean to awaken\\nany notion analogous to that which Boswell has given us of Johnson. The\\nconversation of the latter continually reminds one of the \"pomp and\\ncircumstance of glorious war.\" It was, indeed, a perpetual contest for\\nvictory, or an arbitrary or despotic exaction of homage to his superior\\ntalents. It was strong, acute, prompt, splendid, and vociferous; as loud,\\nstormy, and sublime as those winds which he represents as shaking the\\nHebrides, and rocking the old castle which frowned on the dark-rolling sea\\nbeneath.\\n\\nBut one gets tired of storms, however sublime they may be, and longs for\\nthe more orderly current of nature. Of Franklin, no one ever became tired.\\nThere was no ambition of eloquence, no effort to shine in anything which\\ncame from him. There was nothing which made any demand upon either your\\nallegiance or your admiration. His manner was as unaffected as infancy. It\\nwas nature\\'s self. He talked like an old patriarch; and his plainness and\\nsimplicity put you at once at your ease, and gave you the full and free\\npossession and use of your faculties. His thoughts were of a character to\\nshine by their own light, without any adventitious aid. They only required\\na medium of vision like his pure and simple style, to exhibit to the\\nhighest advantage their native radiance and beauty.\\n\\nHis cheerfulness was unremitting. It seemed to be as much the effect of a\\nsystematic and salutary exercise of the mind, as of its superior\\norganization. His wit was of the first order. It did not show itself\\nmerely in occasional coruscations[1]; but, without any effort or force on\\nhis part, it shed a constant stream of the purest light over the whole of\\nhis discourse. Whether in the company of commons or nobles, he was always\\nthe same plain man; always most perfectly at his ease, with his faculties\\nin full play, and the full orbit of his genius forever clear and\\nunclouded.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Footnote 1: coruscations: flashes of light.]\\n\\nAnd then, the stores of his mind were inexhaustible. He had commenced life\\nwith an attention so vigilant that nothing had escaped his observation;\\nand a judgment so solid that every incident was turned to advantage. His\\nyouth had not been wasted in idleness, nor overcast by intemperance. He\\nhad been, all his life, a close and deep reader, as well as thinker; and\\nby the force of his own powers, had wrought up the raw materials which he\\nhad gathered from books, with such exquisite skill and felicity, that he\\nhas added a hundred fold to their original value, and justly made them his\\nown.\\n\\nNOTES.--Benjamin Franklin (b. 1706, d. 1790) was one of the most prominent\\nmen in the struggle of the American colonies for liberty. He was renowned\\nas a statesman, and, although not an author by profession, was a very\\nprolific writer.

Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?\\nClar. O, I have passed a miserable night,\\n      So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,\\n      That, as I am a Christian, faithful man,\\n      I would not spend another such a night,\\n      Though \\'t were to buy a world of happy days,\\n      So full of dismal terror was the time!\\nBrak. What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.\\nClar. Methoughts, that I had broken from the Tower,\\n      And was embarked to cross to Burgundy;\\n      And, in my company, my brother Gloster;\\n      Who, from my cabin, tempted me to walk\\n      Upon the hatches; thence we looked toward England,\\n      And cited up a thousand fearful times,\\n      During the wars of York and Lancaster,\\n      That had befallen us. As we paced along\\n      Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\\n      Methought that Gloster stumbled; and, in falling,\\n      Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\\n      Into the tumbling billows of the main.\\n      Oh, then, methought, what pain it was to drown!\\n      What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\\n      What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\\n      Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\\n      Ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;\\n      Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\\n      Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\\n      All scattered in the bottom of the sea.\\n      Some lay in dead men\\'s skulls; and, in those holes\\n      Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\\n      As \\'t were in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\\n      Which wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,\\n      And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.\\nBrak. Had you such leisure in the time of death,\\n      To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?\\nClar. Methought I had; and often did I strive\\n      To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\\n      Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth\\n      To seek the empty, vast, and wandering air;\\n      But smothered it within my panting bulk,\\n      Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.\\nBrak. Awaked you not with this sore agony?\\nClar. Oh, no; my dream was lengthened after life;\\n      Oh, then began the tempest to my soul,\\n      Who passed, methought, the melancholy flood,\\n      With that grim ferryman which poets write of,\\n      Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\\n      The first that there did greet my stranger soul,\\n      Was my great father-in-law, renowne\\'d Warwick;\\n      Who cried aloud, \"What scourge for perjury\\n      Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?\"\\n      And so he vanished. Then came wandering by\\n      A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\\n      Dabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud:\\n      \"Clarence is come! false, fleeting, perjured Clarence!\\n      That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury:\\n      Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!\"\\n      With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\\n      Environed me, and howled in mine ears\\n      Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise,\\n      I, trembling, waked, and, for a season after,\\n      Could not believe but that I was in hell;\\n      Such terrible impression made the dream.\\nBrak. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;\\n      I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.\\nClar. O Brakenbury, I have done those things,\\n      Which now bear evidence against my soul,\\n      For Edward\\'s sake; and see how he requites me!\\n      O God! if my deep prayers can not appease thee,\\n      But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\\n      Yet execute thy wrath in me alone:\\n      Oh, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\\n      --I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\\n      My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\\nBrak. I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!\\n\\n          CLARENCE reposes himself on a chair.\\n\\n      Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\\n      Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.\\n\\n                          Shakespeare.--Richard III, Act i, Scene iv.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The houses of York and Lancaster were at war for the possession of\\nthe English throne. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Gloster were\\nbrothers of King Edward IV., who was head of the house of  York. Clarence\\nmarried the daughter of the Earl of Warwick, and joined the latter in\\nseveral insurrections against the king. They finally plotted with Queen\\nMargaret of the Lancaster party for the restoration of the latter house to\\nthe English throne, but Clarence betrayed Warwick and the Queen, and\\nkilled the latter\\'s son at the battle of Tewksbury. Through the plots of\\nGloster, Clarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London, and there\\nmurdered.\\n\\nBrakenbury was lieutenant of the Tower.\\n\\nThe ferryman referred to is Charon, of Greek mythology, who was supposed\\nto ferry the souls of the dead over the river Acheron to the infernal\\nregions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCVI. HOMEWARD BOUND. (371)\\n\\nRichard H. Dana, Jr., 1815-1882, was the son of Richard H. Dana, the poet.\\nHe was born in Cambridge, Mass. In his boyhood be had a strong desire to\\nbe a sailor, but by his father\\'s advice chose a student\\'s life, and\\nentered Harvard University. At the age of nineteen an affection of the\\neyes compelled him to suspend his studies. He now made a voyage to\\nCalifornia as a common sailor, and was gone two years. On his return, he\\nresumed his studies and graduated in 1837. He afterwards studied law, and\\nentered upon an active and successful practice. Most of his life was spent\\nin law and politics, although he won distinction in literature.\\n\\nThe following extract is from his \"Two Years before the Mast,\" a book\\npublished in 1840, giving an account of his voyage to California. This\\nbook details, in a most clear and entertaining manner, the everyday life\\nof a common sailor on shipboard, and is the best known of all Mr. Dana\\'s\\nworks.\\n###\\n\\n\\nIt is usual, in voyages round the Cape from the Pacific, to keep to the\\neastward of the Falkland Islands; but, as there had now set in a strong,\\nsteady, and clear southwester, with every prospect of its lasting, and we\\nhad had enough of high latitudes, the captain determined to stand\\nimmediately to the northward, running inside the Falkland Islands.\\nAccordingly, when the wheel was relieved at eight o\\'clock, the order was\\ngiven to keep her due north, and all hands were turned up to square away\\nthe yards and make sail.\\n\\nIn a moment the news ran through the ship that the captain was keeping her\\noff, with her nose straight for Boston, and Cape Horn over her taffrail.\\nIt was a moment of enthusiasm. Everyone was on the alert, and even the two\\nsick men turned out to lend a hand at the halyards. The wind was now due\\nsouthwest, and blowing a gale to which a vessel close-hauled could have\\nshown no more than a single close-reefed sail; but as we were going before\\nit, we could carry on. Accordingly, hands were sent aloft and a reef\\nshaken out of the topsails, and the reefed foresail set. When we came to\\nmasthead the topsail yards, with all hands at the halyards, we struck up,\\n\"Cheerly, men,\" with a chorus which might have been heard halfway to\\nStaten Island.\\n\\nUnder her increased sail, the ship drove on through the water. Yet she\\ncould bear it well; and the captain sang out from the quarter-deck--\\n\"Another reef out of that fore topsail, and give it to her.\" Two hands\\nsprang aloft; the frozen reef points and earings were cast adrift, the\\nhalyards manned, and the sail gave out her increased canvas to the gale.\\nAll hands were kept on deck to watch the effect of the change. It was as\\nmuch as she could well carry, and with a heavy sea astern, it took two men\\nat the wheel to steer her.\\n\\nShe flung the foam from her bows; the spray breaking aft as far as the\\ngangway. She was going at a prodigious rate. Still, everything held.\\nPreventer braces were reeved and hauled taut; tackles got upon the\\nbackstays; and everything done to keep all snug and strong. The captain\\nwalked the deck at a rapid stride, looked aloft at the sails, and then to\\nwindward; the mate stood in the gangway, rubbing his hands, and talking\\naloud to the ship--\"Hurrah, old bucket! the Boston girls have got hold of\\nthe towrope!\" and the like; and we were on the forecastle looking to see\\nhow the spars stood it, and guessing the rate at which she was\\ngoing,--when the captain called out--\"Mr. Brown, get up the topmast\\nstudding sail! What she can\\'t carry she may drag!\"\\n\\nThe mate looked a moment; but he would let no one be before him in daring.\\nHe sprang forward,--\"Hurrah, men! rig out the topmast studding sail boom!\\nLay aloft, and I\\'ll send the rigging up to you!\" We sprang aloft into the\\ntop; lowered a girtline down, by which we hauled up the rigging; rove the\\ntacks and halyards; ran out the boom and lashed it fast, and sent down the\\nlower halyards as a preventer. It was a clear starlight night, cold and\\nblowing; but everybody worked with a will. Some, indeed, looked as though\\nthey thought the \"old man\" was mad, but no one said a word.\\n\\nWe had had a new topmast studding sail made with a reef in it,--a thing\\nhardly ever heard of, and which the sailors had ridiculed a good deal,\\nsaying that when it was time to reef a studding sail it was time to take\\nit in. But we found a use for it now; for, there being a reef in the\\ntopsail, the studding sail could not be set without one in it also. To be\\nsure, a studding sail with reefed topsails was rather a novelty; yet there\\nwas some reason in it, for if we carried that away, we should lose only a\\nsail and a boom; but a whole topsail might have carried away the mast and\\nall.\\n\\nWhile we were aloft, the sail had been got out, bent to the yard, reefed,\\nand ready for hoisting. Waiting for a good opportunity, the halyards were\\nmanned and the yard hoisted fairly up to the block; but when the mate came\\nto shake the cat\\'s-paw out of the downhaul, and we began to boom end the\\nsail, it shook the ship to her center. The boom buckled up and bent like a\\nwhipstick, and we looked every moment to see something go; but, being of\\nthe short, tough upland spruce, it bent like whalebone, and nothing could\\nbreak it. The carpenter said it was the best stick he had ever seen.\\n\\nThe strength of all hands soon brought the tack to the boom end, and the\\nsheet was trimmed down, and the preventer and the weather brace hauled\\ntaut to take off the strain. Every rope-yarn seemed stretched to the\\nutmost, and every thread of canvas; and with this sail added to her, the\\nship sprang through the water like a thing possessed. The sail being\\nnearly all forward, it lifted her out of the water, and she seemed\\nactually to jump from sea to sea. From the time her keel was laid, she had\\nnever been so driven; and had it been life or death with everyone of us,\\nshe could not have borne another stitch of canvas.\\n\\nFinding that she would bear the sail, the hands we\\'re sent below, and our\\nwatch remained on deck. Two men at the wheel had as much as they could do\\nto keep her within three points of her course, for she steered as wild as\\na young colt. The mate walked the deck, looking at the sails, and then\\nover the side to see the foam fly by her,--slapping his hands upon his\\nthighs and talking to the ship--\"Hurrah, you jade, you\\'ve got the scent!\\nyou know where you\\'re going!\" And when she leaped over the seas, and\\nalmost out of the water, and trembled to her very keel, the spars and\\nmasts snapping and creaking, \"There she goes!--There she\\ngoes--handsomely!--As long as she cracks, she holds!\"--while we stood\\nwith the rigging laid down fair for letting go, and ready to take in sail\\nand clear away if anything went.\\n\\nAt four bells we have the log, and she was going eleven knots fairly; and\\nhad it not been for the sea from aft which sent the chip home, and threw\\nher continually off her course, the log would have shown her to have been\\ngoing somewhat faster. I went to the wheel with a young fellow from the\\nKennebec, who was a good helmsman; and for two hours we had our hands\\nfull. A few minutes showed us that our monkey jackets must come off; and,\\ncold as it was, we stood in our shirt sleeves in a perspiration, and were\\nglad enough to have it eight bells and the wheels relieved. We turned in\\nand slept as well as we could, though the sea made a constant roar under\\nher bows, and washed over the forecastle like a small cataract.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The Falkland Islands are a group in the Atlantic just east of Cape\\nHorn.\\n\\nBells. On shipboard time is counted in bells, the bell being struck every\\nhalf hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nCVII. IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS. (375)\\n\\nThomas Babington Macaulay, 1800-1859, was born in the village of Rothley,\\nLeicestershire. On his father\\'s side, he descended from Scotch Highlanders\\nand ministers of the kirk. His education began at home, and was completed\\nat Trinity College, Cambridge. While a student, he gained much reputation\\nas a writer and a debater. In 1826 he was admitted to the bar. In 1825\\nbegan his connection with the \"Edinburgh Review,\" which continued twenty\\nyears. Some of his most brilliant essays appeared first in its pages. He\\nwas first chosen to Parliament in 1830, and was reelected several times.\\nIn 1840 his essays and some other writings were collected and published\\nwith the title of \"Miscellanies.\" His  \"Lays of Ancient Rome\" was\\npublished in 1842. His \"History of England\" was published near the close\\nof his life. In 1857 he was given the title of Baron Macaulay. \"His style\\nis vigorous, rapid in its movement, and brilliant; and yet, with all its\\nsplendor, has a crystalline clearness. Indeed, the fault generally found\\nwith his style is, that it is so constantly brilliant that the vision is\\ndazzled and wearied with its excessive brightness.\" He has sometimes been\\ncharged with sacrificing facts to fine sentences.\\n\\nIn his statesmanship, Macaulay was always an earnest defender of liberty.\\nHis first speech in Parliament was in support of a bill to remove the\\ncivil disabilities of the Jews, and his whole parliamentary career was\\nconsistent with this wise and liberal beginning.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe place in which the impeachment of Warren Hastings was conducted, was\\nworthy of such a trial. It was the great hall of William Rufus; the hall\\nwhich had resounded with acclamations at the inauguration of thirty kings;\\nthe hall which had witnessed the just sentence of Bacon, and the just\\nabsolution of Somers; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford had for a\\nmoment awed and melted a victorious party inflamed with just resentment;\\nthe hall where Charles had confronted the High Court of Justice with the\\nplacid courage which half redeemed his fame.\\n\\nNeither military nor civil pomp was wanting. The avenues were lined with\\ngrenadiers. The streets were kept clear by cavalry. The peers, robed in\\ngold and ermine, were marshaled by heralds. The judges, in their vestments\\nof state, attended to give advice on points of law. The long galleries\\nwere crowded by such an audience as has rarely excited the fears or the\\nemulation of an orator. There were gathered together, from all parts of a\\ngreat, free, enlightened, and prosperous realm, grace and female\\nloveliness, wit and learning, the representatives of every science and of\\nevery art.\\n\\nThere were seated around the queen, the fair-haired, young daughters of\\nthe house of Brunswick. There the embassadors of great kings and\\ncommonwealths gazed with admiration on a spectacle which no other country\\nin the world could present. There Siddons, in the prime of her majestic\\nbeauty, looked with emotion on a scene surpassing all the imitations of\\nthe stage. There Gibbon, the historian of the Roman Empire, thought of the\\ndays when Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres; and when,\\nbefore a senate which had still some show of freedom, Tacitus thundered\\nagainst the oppressor of Africa. There, too, were seen, side by side, the\\ngreatest painter and the greatest scholar of the age; for the spectacle\\nhad allured Reynolds from his easel and Parr from his study.\\n\\nThe sergeants made proclamation. Hastings advanced to the bar, and bent\\nhis knee. The culprit was indeed not unworthy of that great presence. He\\nhad ruled an extensive and populous country; had made laws and treaties;\\nhad sent forth armies; had set up and pulled down princes; and in his high\\nplace he had so borne himself, that all had feared him, that most had\\nloved him, and that hatred itself could deny him no title to glory, except\\nvirtue. A person, small and emaciated, yet deriving dignity from a\\ncarriage which, while it indicated deference to the court, indicated,\\nalso, habitual self-possession and self-respect; a high and intellectual\\nforehead; a brow, pensive, but not gloomy; a mouth of inflexible decision;\\na face, pale and worn, but serene, on which a great and well-balanced mind\\nwas legibly written: such was the aspect with which the great proconsul\\npresented himself to his judges.\\n\\nThe charges, and the answers of Hastings, were first read. This ceremony\\noccupied two whole days. On the third, Burke rose. Four sittings of the\\ncourt were occupied by his opening speech, which was intended to be a\\ngeneral introduction to all the charges. With an exuberance of thought and\\na splendor of diction, which more than satisfied the highly raised\\nexpectations of the audience, he described the character and institutions\\nof the natives of India; recounted the circumstances in which the Asiatic\\nEmpire of Britain had originated; and set forth the constitution of the\\nCompany and of the English Presidencies.\\n\\nHaving thus attempted to communicate to his hearers an idea of eastern\\nsociety, as vivid as that which existed in his own mind, he proceeded to\\narraign the administration of Hastings, as systematically conducted in\\ndefiance of morality and public law. The energy and pathos of the great\\norator extorted expressions of unwonted admiration from all; and, for a\\nmoment, seemed to pierce even the resolute heart of the defendant. The\\nladies in the galleries, unaccustomed to such displays of eloquence,\\nexcited by the solemnity of the occasion, and perhaps not unwilling to\\ndisplay their taste and sensibility, were in a state of uncontrollable\\nemotion. Handkerchiefs were pulled out; smelling bottles were handed\\nround; hysterical sobs and screams were heard, and some were even carried\\nout in fits.\\n\\nAt length the orator concluded. Raising his voice, till the old arches of\\nIrish oak resounded--\"Therefore,\" said he, \"hath it with all confidence\\nbeen ordered by the Commons of Great Britain, that I impeach Warren\\nHastings of high crimes and misdemeanors. I impeach him in the name of the\\nCommons House of Parliament, whose trust he has betrayed. I impeach him in\\nthe name of the English nation, whose ancient honor he has sullied. I\\nimpeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has\\ntrodden under foot, and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly,\\nin the name of human nature itself, in the name of both sexes, in the name\\nof every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and\\noppressor of all.\"\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Warren Hastings (b. 1732, d. 1818) was Governor-general of British\\nIndia. He was impeached for maladministration, but, after a trial which\\nextended from Feb. 13th, 1788, to April 23d, 1795, and occupied one\\nhundred and forty-eight days, he was acquitted by a large majority on each\\nseparate count of the impeachment.\\n\\nWilliam Rufus, or William II. (b. 1056, d. 1100), built Westminster Hall\\nin which the trial was held. Bacon; see biographical notice, pages 332 and\\n333. Somers, John (b. 1651. d. 1716) was impeached for maladministration\\nwhile holding the office of lord chamberlain. Strafford, Thomas Wentworth,\\nearl of, (b. 1593, d. 1641,) was impeached for his mismanagement while\\ngovernor of Ireland. He conducted his own defense with such eloquence that\\nthe original impeachment was abandoned, although he was immediately\\ncondemned for high treason and executed. Charles I. (b. 1600, d. 1649),\\nafter a war with Parliament, in which the rights of the people were at\\nissue, was captured, tried, and condemned to death.\\n\\nThe House of Brunswick is one of the oldest families of Germany.

DESTRUCTION OF THE CARNATIC.\\n\\nEdmund Burke, 1730-1797, one of the most able and brilliant of England\\'s\\nessayists, orators, and statesmen, was born in Dublin, and was the son of\\nan able lawyer. He graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1748. As a\\nstudent, he was distinguished for ability and industry. From 1750 to 1766\\nhe was in London writing for periodicals, publishing books, or serving as\\nprivate secretary. His work on \"The Sublime and Beautiful\" appeared in\\n1756. From 1766 to 1794 he was a member of Parliament, representing at\\ndifferent times different constituencies. On the first day of his\\nappearance in the House of Commons he made a successful speech. \"In the\\nthree principal questions which excited his interest, and called forth the\\nmost splendid displays of his eloquence--the contest with the American\\nColonies, the impeachment of Warren Hastings, and the French\\nRevolution--we see displayed a philanthropy the most pure, illustrated by\\na genius the most resplendent.\" Mr. Burke\\'s foresight, uprightness,\\nintegrity, learning, magnanimity, and eloquence made him one of the most\\nconspicuous men of his time; and his writings stand among the noblest\\ncontributions to English literature.\\n###\\n\\n\\nWhen at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either would\\nsign no convention, or whom no treaty and no signature could bind, and who\\nwere the determined enemies of human intercourse itself, he decreed to\\nmake the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestinated\\ncriminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved, in the gloomy\\nrecesses of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the whole Carnatic\\nan everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put perpetual desolation as a\\nbarrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral\\nelements of the world together was no protection.\\n\\nHe became at length so confident of his force, so collected in his might,\\nthat he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution. Having\\nterminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival, who buried their\\nmutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of\\nthe Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity\\ncould add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction; and compounding\\nall the materials of fury, havoc, and desolation into one black cloud, he\\nhung for a while on the declivities of the mountains.\\n\\nWhilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on\\nthis menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly burst,\\nand poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic.\\n\\nThen ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart\\nconceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of war\\nbefore known or heard of, were mercy to that new havoc. A storm of\\nuniversal fire blasted every field, consumed every house, destroyed every\\ntemple. The miserable inhabitants, flying from their flaming villages, in\\npart were slaughtered; others, without regard to sex, to age, to the\\nrespect of rank, or sacredness of function,--fathers torn from children,\\nhusbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and, amidst the\\ngoading spears of drivers, and the trampling of pursuing horses,--were\\nswept into captivity, in an unknown and hostile land.\\n\\nThose who were able to evade this tempest, fled to the walled cities; but\\nescaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.\\nThe alms of the settlement of Madras, in this dreadful exigency, were\\ncertainly liberal, and all was done by charity that private charity could\\ndo; but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation which stretched out\\nits hands for food.\\n\\nFor months together these creatures of sufferance, whose very excess and\\nluxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of\\nour austerest fasts, silent, patient, resigned, without sedition or\\ndisturbance, almost without complaint, perished by a hundred a day in the\\nstreets of Madras; every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the\\nstreets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and expired of famine in the granary\\nof India.\\n\\nI was going to wake your justice toward this unhappy part of our\\nfellow-citizens, by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this\\nplague of hunger. Of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of\\nman, this comes the nearest to our heart, and is that wherein the proudest\\nof us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is.\\n\\nBut I find myself unable to manage it with decorum. These details are of a\\nspecies of horror so nauseous and disgusting; they are so degrading to the\\nsufferers and to the hearers; they are so humiliating to human nature\\nitself, that, on better thoughts, I find it more advisable to throw a pall\\nover this hideous object, and to leave it to your general conceptions.\\n\\nFor eighteen months, without intermission, this destruction raged from the\\ngates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and so completely did these\\nmasters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious son, absolve\\nthemselves of their impious vow, that when the British armies traversed,\\nas they did, the Carnatic, for hundreds of miles in all directions,\\nthrough the whole line of their march they did not see one man--not one\\nwoman--not one child--not one four-footed beast of any description\\nwhatever! One dead, uniform silence reigned over the whole region.\\n\\nWith the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few\\nforts, I wish to be understood as speaking literally;--I mean to produce\\nto you more than three witnesses, who will support this assertion in its\\nfull extent. That hurricane of war passed through every part of the\\ncentral provinces of the Carnatic. Six or seven districts to the north and\\nto the south (and these not wholly untouched) escaped the general ravage.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--This selection is an extract from Burke\\'s celebrated speech in\\nParliament, in 1785, on the Nabob of Arcot\\'s debts; it bore upon the\\nmaladministration of Hastings.\\n\\nArcot, a district in India, had been ceded to the British on condition\\nthat they should pay the former ruler\\'s debts. These were found to be\\nenormous, and the creditors proved to be individuals in the East India\\nCompany\\'s employ. The creditors, for their private gain, induced the Nabob\\nto attempt the subjugation of other native princes, among whom was Hyder\\nAli. The latter at first made successful resistance, and compelled the\\nNabob and his allies to sign a treaty. The treaty was not kept, and the\\ndestruction above recounted took place.\\n\\nThe Carnatic is a province in British India, on the eastern side of the\\npeninsula; it contains about 50,000 square miles. Madras is a city, and\\nTanjore a town, in this province.\\n\\n\\n\\nCIX. THE RAVEN.\\n\\nEdgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849, was born in Boston, and died in Baltimore. He\\nwas left a destitute orphan at an early age, and was adopted by Mr. John\\nAllan, a wealthy citizen of Richmond. He entered the University of\\nVirginia, at Charlottesville, where he excelled in his studies, and was\\nalways at the head of his class; but he was compelled to leave on account\\nof irregularities. He was afterwards appointed a cadet at West Point, but\\nfailed to graduate there for the same reason. Poe now quarreled with his\\nbenefactor and left his house never to return. During the rest of his\\nmelancholy career, he obtained a precarious livelihood by different\\nliterary enterprises. His ability as a writer gained him positions with\\nvarious periodicals in Richmond, New York, and Philadelphia, and during\\nthis time he wrote some of his finest prose. The appearance of \"The Raven\"\\nin 1845, however, at once made Poe a literary lion. He was quite\\nsuccessful for a time, but then fell back into his dissipated habits which\\nfinally caused his death. In his personal appearance, Poe was neat and\\ngentlemanly; his face was expressive of intellect and sensibility; and his\\nmental powers in some directions were of a high order. His writings show\\ncare, and a great degree of skill in their construction; but their effect\\nis generally morbid.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  Once upon a midnight dreary,\\n  While I pondered, weak and weary,\\nOver many a quaint and curious\\n    Volume of forgotten lore--\\n  While I nodded, nearly napping,\\n  Suddenly there came a tapping,\\n  As of some one gently rapping,\\n    Rapping at my chamber door.\\n  \"\\'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered,\\n    \"Tapping at my chamber door\\n      Only this, and nothing more.\"\\n\\n  Ah, distinctly I remember,\\n  It was in the bleak December,\\nAnd each separate dying ember\\n    Wrought its ghost upon the floor.\\n  Eagerly I wished the morrow;\\n  Vainly I had sought to borrow\\n  From my books surcease of sorrow\\n    Sorrow for the lost Lenore--\\nFor the rare and radiant maiden\\n    Whom the angels name Lenore--\\n      Nameless here for evermore.\\n\\n  And the silken, sad, uncertain\\n  Rustling of each purple curtain\\nThrilled me,--filled me with fantastic\\n    Terrors, never felt before;\\n  So that now, to still the beating\\n  Of my heart, I stood repeating,\\n    \" \\'Tis some visitor entreating\\n    Entrance at my chamber door\\n  Some late visitor entreating\\n    Entrance at my chamber door;\\n      This it is, and nothing more.\"\\n\\n  Presently my soul grew stronger;\\n  Hesitating then no longer,\\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly\\n    Your forgiveness I implore;\\n  But the fact is I was napping,\\n  And so gently you came rapping,\\n  And so faintly you came tapping,\\n    Tapping at my chamber door,\\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you.\"--\\n    Here I opened wide the door;\\n      Darkness there, and nothing more.\\n\\n  Deep into that darkness peering,\\n  Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,\\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals\\n    Ever dared to dream before;\\n  But the silence was unbroken,\\n  And the stillness gave no token,\\n  And the only word there spoken\\n    Was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\\nThis I whispered, and an echo\\n    Murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\\n      Merely this, and nothing more.\\n\\n  Back into the chamber turning,\\n  All my soul within me burning,\\nSoon again I heard a tapping,\\n    Something louder than before.\\n  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely, that is\\n  Something at my window lattice;\\n  Let me see then, what thereat is,\\n    And this mystery explore--\\nLet my heart be still a moment,\\n    And this mystery explore;--\\n      \\'Tis the wind, and nothing more.\"\\n\\n  Open here I flung the shutter.\\n  When, with many a flirt and flutter,\\nIn there stepped a stately Raven\\n    Of the saintly days of yore;\\n  Not the least obeisance made he;\\n  Not a minute stopped or stayed he,\\n  But, with mien of lord or lady,\\n    Perched above my chamber door--\\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas\\n    Just above my chamber door--\\n      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\\n\\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling\\n  My sad fancy into smiling,\\nBy the grave and stern decorum\\n    Of the countenance it wore,\\n  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven,\\n  Thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\\n  Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,\\n    Wandering from the nightly shore,\\nTell me what thy lordly name is\\n    On the night\\'s Plutonian shore!\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  Much I marveled this ungainly\\n  Fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\\nThough its answer little meaning--\\n    Little relevancy bore;\\n  For we can not help agreeing\\n  That no living human being\\n  Ever yet was blest with seeing\\n    Bird above his chamber door--\\nBird or beast upon the sculptured\\n    Bust above his chamber door,\\n      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely\\n  On that placid bust, spoke only\\nThat one word, as if his soul in\\n    That one word he did outpour.\\n  Nothing farther then he uttered,\\n  Not a feather then he fluttered,\\n  Till I scarcely more than muttered,\\n    \"Other friends have flown before--\\nOn the morrow he will leave me,\\n    As my Hopes have flown before.\"\\n      Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  Startled at the stillness broken\\n  By reply so aptly spoken,\\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters\\n    Is its only stock and store,\\n  Caught from some unhappy master\\n  Whom unmerciful Disaster\\n  Followed fast and followed faster\\n    Till his songs one burden bore--\\nTill the dirges of his Hope that\\n    Melancholy burden bore\\n      Of \\'Never--nevermore.\\' \"\\n\\n  But the Raven still beguiling\\n  All my sad soul into smiling,\\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in\\n    Front of bird, and bust, and door;\\n  Then, upon the velvet sinking,\\n  I betook myself to linking\\n  Fancy unto fancy, thinking\\n    What this ominous bird of yore--\\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly,\\n    Gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\\n      Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  This I sat engaged in guessing,\\n  But no syllable expressing\\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now\\n    Burned into my bosom\\'s core;\\n  This and more I sat divining,\\n  With my head at ease reclining\\n  On the cushion\\'s velvet lining\\n    That the lamplight gloated o\\'er,\\nBut whose velvet violet lining,\\n    With the lamplight gloating o\\'er\\n      She shall press, ah, nevermore!\\n\\n  Then, methought, the air grew denser,\\n  Perfumed from an unseen censer\\nSwung by Seraphim, whose footfalls\\n    Tinkled on the tufted floor.\\n  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--\\n  By these angels he hath sent thee\\n  Respite--respite and nepenthe [1]\\n    From thy memories of Lenore!\\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe,\\n    And forget this lost Lenore!\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note 1: nepenthe--A drug to relieve grief, by blocking\\nmemory of sorrow or pain.]\\n\\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--\\n  Prophet still, if bird or devil!--\\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether\\n    Tempest tossed thee here ashore,\\n  Desolate, yet all undaunted,\\n  On this desert land enchanted--\\n  On this home by Horror haunted--\\n    Tell me truly, I implore--\\nIs there--is there balm in Gilead?\\n    Tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil,--\\n  Prophet still, if bird or devil!--\\nBy that heaven that bends above us,\\n    By that God we both adore,\\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden,\\n  If, within the distant Aidenn,\\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden\\n    Whom the angels name Lenore--\\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden,\\n    Whom the angels name Lenore.\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  \"Be that word our sign of parting,\\n  Bird or fiend,\" I shrieked, upstarting;\\n\"Get thee back into the tempest\\n    And the night\\'s Plutonian shore!\\n  Leave no black plume as a token\\n  Of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\\n  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--\\n    Quit the bust above my door!\\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and\\n    Take thy form from off my door!\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  And the Raven, never flitting,\\n  Still is sitting, still is sitting\\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas\\n    Just above my chamber door;\\n  And his eyes have all the seeming\\n  Of a demon\\'s that is dreaming,\\n  And the lamplight o\\'er him streaming\\n    Throws his shadow on the floor;\\nAnd my soul from out that shadow,\\n    That lies floating on the floor,\\n      Shall be lifted--nevermore!\\n\\nNOTES.--Pallas, or Minerva, in ancient mythology, was the goddess of\\nwisdom.\\n\\nPlutonian, see note on Pluto, page

A VIEW OF THE COLOSSEUM. (389)\\n\\nOrville Dewey, 1794-1882, a well known Unitarian clergyman and author, was\\nborn in Sheffield, Massachusetts, graduated with distinction at Williams\\nCollege in 1814, and afterward studied theology at Andover. For a while he\\nwas assistant to Dr. W. E. Channing in Boston, and later, was a pastor in\\nNew Bedford, New York City, and Boston. He made two or three voyages to\\nEurope, and published accounts of his travels.\\n\\n\"Discourses on Human Life,\" \"Discourses on the Nature of Religion,\"\\n\"Discourses on Commerce and Business,\" are among his published works. His\\nwritings are both philosophical and practical; and, as a preacher, he was\\nesteemed original, earnest, and impressive.\\n###\\n\\n\\nOn the eighth of November, from the high land, about fourteen miles\\ndistant, I first saw Rome; and although there is something very\\nunfavorable to impression in the expectation that you are to be greatly\\nimpressed, or that you ought to be, or that such is the fashion; yet Rome\\nis too mighty a name to be withstood by such or any other influences. Let\\nyou come upon that hill in what mood you may, the scene will lay hold upon\\nyou as with the hand of a giant. I scarcely know how to describe the\\nimpression, but it seemed to me as if something strong and stately, like\\nthe slow and majestic march of a mighty whirlwind, swept around those\\neternal towers; the storms of time, that had prostrated the proudest\\nmonuments of the world, seemed to have left their vibrations in the still\\nand solemn air; ages of history passed before me; the mighty procession of\\nnations, kings, consuls, emperors, empires, and generations had passed\\nover that sublime theater. The fire, the storm, the earthquake, had gone\\nby; but there was yet left the still, small voice like that at which the\\nprophet \"wrapped his face in his mantle.\"\\n\\nI went to see the Colosseum by moonlight. It is the monarch, the majesty\\nof all ruins; there is nothing like it. All the associations of the place,\\ntoo, give it the most impressive character. When you enter within this\\nstupendous circle of ruinous walls and arches, and grand terraces of\\nmasonry, rising one above another, you stand upon the arena of the old\\ngladiatorial combats and Christian martyrdom; and as you lift your eyes to\\nthe vast amphitheater, you meet, in imagination, the eyes of a hundred\\nthousand Romans, assembled to witness these bloody spectacles. What a\\nmultitude and mighty array of human beings; and how little do we know in\\nmodern times of great assemblies! One, two, and three, and, at its last\\nenlargement by Constantine, more than three hundred thousand persons could\\nbe seated in the Circus Maximus!\\n\\nBut to return to the Colosseum; we went up under the conduct of a guide\\nupon the walls and terraces, or embankments, which supported the ranges of\\nseats. The seats have long since disappeared; and grass overgrows the\\nspots where the pride, and power, and wealth, and beauty of Rome sat down\\nto its barbarous entertainments. What thronging life was here then! What\\nvoices, what greetings, what hurrying footsteps upon the staircases of the\\neighty arches of entrance! And now, as we picked our way carefully through\\nthe decayed passages, or cautiously ascended some moldering flight of\\nsteps, or stood by the lonely walls--ourselves silent, and, for a wonder,\\nthe guide silent, too--there was no sound here but of the bat, and none\\ncame from without but the roll of a distant carriage, or the convent bell\\nfrom the summit of the neighboring Esquiline.\\n\\nIt is scarcely possible to describe the effect of moonlight upon this\\nruin. Through a hundred lonely arches and blackened passageways it\\nstreamed in, pure, bright, soft, lambent, and yet distinct and clear, as\\nif it came there at once to reveal, and cheer, and pity the mighty\\ndesolation. But if the Colosseum is a mournful and desolate spectacle as\\nseen from within--without, and especially on the side which is in best\\npreservation, it is glorious. We passed around it; and, as we looked\\nupward, the moon shining through its arches, from the opposite side, it\\nappeared as if it were the coronet of the heavens, so vast was it--or like\\na glorious crown upon the brow of night.\\n\\nI feel that I do not and can not describe this mighty ruin. I can only say\\nthat I came away paralyzed, and as passive as a child. A soldier stretched\\nout his hand for \"un dona,\" as we passed the guard; and when my companion\\nsaid I did wrong to give, I told him that I should have given my cloak, if\\nthe man had asked it. Would you break any spell that worldly feeling or\\nselfish sorrow may have spread over your mind, go and see the Colosseum by\\nmoonlight.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The Colosseum (pro. Col-os-se\\'um) was commenced by the Roman\\nemperor Vespasian, and was completed by Titus, his son, 79 A.D. Its\\nconstruction occupied but three years, notwithstanding its size; a great\\npart of its walls are standing today.\\n\\nThe Circus Maximus was an amphitheater built by Tarquin the Elder about\\n600 B. C.\\n\\nConstantine. See note on page 175.\\n\\nThe Esquiline is one of the seven hills upon which Rome is built.  Un\\ndona, an Italian phrase meaning a gift or alms.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXI. THE BRIDGE. (392)\\n\\nI stood on the bridge at midnight,\\n  As the clocks were striking the hour,\\nAnd the moon rose o\\'er the city,\\n  Behind the dark church tower.\\n\\nI saw her bright reflection\\n  In the waters under me,\\nLike a golden goblet falling\\n  And sinking into the sea.\\n\\nAnd far in the hazy distance\\n  Of that lovely night in June,\\nThe blaze of the flaming furnace\\n  Gleamed redder than the moon.\\n\\nAmong the long, black rafters\\n  The wavering shadows lay,\\nAnd the current that came from the ocean\\n  Seemed to lift and bear them away;\\n\\nAs, sweeping and eddying through them,\\n  Rose the belated tide,\\nAnd, streaming into the moonlight,\\n  The seaweed floated wide.\\n\\nAnd like those waters rushing\\n  Among the wooden piers,\\nA flood of thoughts came o\\'er me\\n  That filled my eyes with tears\\n\\nHow often, oh, how often,\\n  In the days that had gone by,\\nI had stood on that bridge at midnight\\n  And gazed on that wave and sky!\\n\\nHow often, oh, how often,\\n  I had wished that the ebbing tide\\nWould bear me away on its bosom\\n  O\\'er the ocean wild and wide.\\n\\nFor my heart was hot and restless,\\n  And my life was full of care,\\nAnd the burden laid upon me\\n  Seemed greater than I could bear.\\n\\nBut now it has fallen from me,\\n  It is buried in the sea;\\nAnd only the sorrow of others\\n  Throws its shadow over me.\\n\\nYet, whenever I cross the river\\n  On its bridge with wooden piers,\\nLike the odor of brine from the ocean\\n  Comes the thought of other years.\\n\\nAnd I think how many thousands\\n  Of care-encumbered men,\\nEach bearing his burden of sorrow,\\n  Have crossed the bridge since then.\\n\\nI see the long procession\\n  Still passing to and fro,\\nThe young heart hot and restless,\\n  And the old, subdued and slow!\\n\\nAnd forever and forever,\\n  As long as the river flows,\\nAs long as the heart has passions,\\n  As long as life has woes;\\n\\nThe moon and its broken reflection\\n  And its shadows shall appear\\nAs the symbol of love in heaven,\\n  And its wavering image here.\\n                             --Longfellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXII. OBJECTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENCE. (394)\\n\\nRobert Charles Winthrop, 1809-1894, was a descendant of John Winthrop, the\\nfirst Governor of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay. He was born in Boston,\\nstudied at the public Latin School, graduated at Harvard in 1828, and\\nstudied law with Daniel Webster. Possessing an ample fortune, he made\\nlittle effort to practice his profession. In 1834 he was elected to the\\nLegislature of his native state, and was reelected five times; three years\\nhe was Speaker of the House of Representatives. In 1840 he was chosen to\\nCongress, and sat as Representative for ten years. In 1847 he was chosen\\nSpeaker of the House. He also served a short time in the Senate. His\\npublished writings are chiefly in the form of addresses and speeches; they\\nare easy, finished, and scholarly. As a speaker, Mr. Winthrop was ready,\\nfull-voiced, and self-possessed.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThere are fields enough for the wildest and most extravagant theorizings,\\nwithin man\\'s own appropriate domain, without overleaping the barriers\\nwhich separate things human and divine. Indeed, I have often thought that\\nmodern science had afforded a most opportune and providential safety valve\\nfor the intellectual curiosity and ambition of man, at a moment when the\\nprogress of education, invention, and liberty had roused and stimulated\\nhim to a pitch of such unprecedented eagerness and ardor. Astronomy,\\nChemistry, and, more than all, Geology, with their incidental branches of\\nstudy, have opened an inexhaustible field for investigation and\\nspeculation. Here, by the aid of modern instruments and modern modes of\\nanalysis, the most ardent and earnest spirits may find ample room and\\nverge enough for their insatiate activity and audacious enterprise, and\\nmay pursue their course not only without the slightest danger of doing\\nmischief to others, but with the certainty of promoting the great end of\\nscientific truth.\\n\\nLet them lift their vast reflectors or refractors to the skies, and detect\\nnew planets in their hiding places. Let them waylay the fugitive comets in\\ntheir flight, and compel them to disclose the precise period of their\\norbits, and to give bonds for their punctual return. Let them drag out\\nreluctant satellites from \"their habitual concealments.\" Let them resolve\\nthe unresolvable nebulae of Orion or Andromeda. They need not fear. The\\nsky will not fall, nor a single star be shaken from its sphere.\\n\\nLet them perfect and elaborate their marvelous processes of making the\\nlight and the lightning their ministers, for putting \"a pencil of rays\"\\ninto the hand of art, and providing tongues of fire for the communication\\nof intelligence. Let them foretell the path of the whirlwind, and\\ncalculate the orbit of the storm. Let them hang out their gigantic\\npendulums, and make the earth do the work of describing and measuring her\\nown motions.\\n\\nLet them annihilate human pain, and literally \"charm ache with air, and\\nagony with ether.\" The blessing of God will attend all their toils, and\\nthe gratitude of man will await all their triumphs. Let them dig down into\\nthe bowels of the earth. Let them rive asunder the massive rocks, and\\nunfold the history of creation as it lies written on the pages of their\\npiled up strata. Let them gather up the fossil fragments of a lost Fauna,\\nreproducing the ancient forms which inhabited the land or the seas,\\nbringing them together, bone to his bone, till Leviathan and Behemoth\\nstand before us in bodily presence and in their full proportions, and we\\nalmost tremble lest these dry bones should live again! Let them put nature\\nto the rack, and torture her, in all her forms, to the betrayal of her\\ninmost secrets and confidences. They need not forbear. The foundations of\\nthe round world have been laid so strong that they can not be moved.\\n\\nBut let them not think by searching to find out God. Let them not dream of\\nunderstanding the Almighty to perfection. Let them not dare to apply their\\ntests and solvents, their modes of analysis or their terms of definition,\\nto the secrets of the spiritual kingdom. Let them spare the foundations of\\nfaith. Let them be satisfied with what is revealed of the mysteries of the\\nDivine Nature. Let them not break through the bounds to gaze after the\\nInvisible.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Orion and Andromeda are the names of two constellations.\\n\\nThe Leviathan is described in Job, chap. xli, and the Behemoth in Job,\\nchap. xl.

(396)\\n\\nO Sacred Truth! thy triumph ceased a while,\\nAnd Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,\\nWhen leagued Oppression poured to northern wars\\nHer whiskered pandours and her fierce hussars,\\nWaved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,\\nPealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet horn;\\nTumultuous horror brooded o\\'er her van,\\nPresaging wrath to Poland--and to man!\\n\\nWarsaw\\'s last champion, from her height surveyed,\\nWide o\\'er the fields a waste of ruin laid;\\n\"O Heaven!\" he cried, \"my bleeding country save!\\nIs there no hand on high to shield the brave?\\nYet, though destruction sweep those lovely plains,\\nRise, fellow-men! our country yet remains!\\nBy that dread name, we wave the sword on high,\\nAnd swear for her to live--with her to die!\"\\n\\nHe said, and on the rampart heights arrayed\\nHis trusty warriors, few, but undismayed;\\nFirm-paced and slow, a horrid front they form,\\nStill as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;\\nLow murmuring sounds along their banners fly,\\nRevenge or death--the watchword and reply;\\nThen pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,\\nAnd the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm.\\n\\nIn vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!\\nFrom rank to rank, your volleyed thunder flew!\\nOh, bloodiest picture in the book of time,\\nSarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;\\nFound not a generous friend, a pitying foe,\\nStrength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe!\\nDropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,\\nClosed her bright eye, and curbed her high career;\\nHope, for a season, bade the world farewell,\\nAnd Freedom shrieked as Kosciusko fell!\\n                                         --Thomas Campbell.\\n\\nNOTES.--Kosciusko (b. 1746, d. 1817), a celebrated Polish patriot, who had\\nserved in the American Revolution, was besieged at Warsaw, in 1794, by a\\nlarge force of Russians, Prussians, and Austrians. After the siege was\\nraised, he marched against a force of Russians much larger than his own,\\nand was defeated. He was himself severely wounded and captured.\\n\\nSarmatia is the ancient name for a region of Europe which embraced Poland,\\nbut was of greater extent.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXIV. LABOR. (398)\\n\\nHorace Greeley,1811-1872, perhaps the most famous editor of America, was\\nborn in Amherst, New Hampshire, of poor parents. His boyhood was passed in\\nfarm labor, in attending the common school, and in reading every book on\\nwhich he could lay his hands. His reading was mostly done by the light of\\npine knots. At fifteen he entered a printing office in Vermont, became the\\nbest workman in the office, and continued to improve every opportunity for\\nstudy. At the age of twenty he appeared in New York City, poorly clothed,\\nand almost destitute of money. He worked at his trade for a year or two,\\nand then set up printing for himself. For several years he was not\\nsuccessful, but struggled on, performing an immense amount of work as an\\neditor. In 1841 he established the \"New York Tribune,\" which soon became\\none of the most successful and influential papers in the country. In 1848\\nhe was elected to Congress, but remained but a short time. In 1872 he was\\na candidate for the Presidency, was defeated, and died a few days\\nafterward. Mr. Greeley is a rare example of what may be accomplished by\\nhonesty and unflinching industry. Besides the vast amount which he wrote\\nfor the newspapers, he published several books; the best known of which is\\n\"The American Conflict.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nEvery child should be trained to dexterity in some useful branch of\\nproductive industry, not in order that he shall certainly follow that\\npursuit, but that he may at all events be able to do so in case he shall\\nfail in the more intellectual or artificial calling which he may prefer to\\nit. Let him seek to be a doctor, lawyer, preacher, poet, if he will; but\\nlet him not stake his all on success in that pursuit, but have a second\\nline to fall back upon if driven from his first. Let him be so reared and\\ntrained that he may enter, if he will, upon some intellectual calling in\\nthe sustaining consciousness that he need not debase himself, nor do\\nviolence to his convictions, in order to achieve success therein, since he\\ncan live and thrive in another (if you choose, humbler) vocation, if\\ndriven from that of his choice. This buttress to integrity, this assurance\\nof self-respect, is to be found in a universal training to efficiency in\\nProductive Labor.\\n\\nThe world is full of misdirection and waste; but all the calamities and\\nlosses endured by mankind through frost, drought, blight, hail, fires,\\nearthquakes, inundations, are as nothing to those habitually suffered by\\nthem through human idleness and inefficiency, mainly caused (or excused)\\nby lack of industrial training. It is quite within the truth to estimate\\nthat one tenth of our people, in the average, are habitually idle because\\n(as they say) they can find no employment. They look for work where it can\\nnot be had. They seem to be, or they are, unable to do such as abundantly\\nconfronts and solicits them. Suppose these to average but one million\\nable-bodied persons, and that their work is worth but one dollar each per\\nday; our loss by involuntary idleness can not be less than $300,000,000\\nper annum. I judge that it is actually $500,000,000. Many who stand\\nwaiting to be hired could earn from two to five dollars per day had they\\nbeen properly trained to work. \"There is plenty of room higher up,\" said\\nDaniel Webster, in response to an inquiry as to the prospects of a young\\nman just entering upon the practice of law; and there is never a dearth of\\nemployment for men or women of signal capacity or skill. In this city, ten\\nthousand women are always doing needlework for less than fifty cents per\\nday, finding themselves; yet twice their number of capable, skillful\\nseamstresses could find steady employment and good living in wealthy\\nfamilies at not less than one dollar per day over and above board and\\nlodging. He who is a good blacksmith, a fair millwright, a tolerable wagon\\nmaker, and can chop timber, make fence, and manage a small farm if\\nrequired, is always sure of work and fair recompense; while he or she who\\ncan keep books or teach music fairly, but knows how to do nothing else, is\\nin constant danger of falling into involuntary idleness and consequent\\nbeggary. It is a broad, general truth, that no boy was ever yet inured to\\ndaily, systematic, productive labor in field or shop throughout the latter\\nhalf of his minority, who did not prove a useful man, and was notable to\\nfind work whenever he wished it.\\n\\nYet to the ample and constant employment of a whole community one\\nprerequisite is indispensable,--that a variety of pursuits shall have been\\ncreated or naturalized therein. A people who have but a single source of\\nprofit are uniformly poor, not because that vocation is necessarily\\nill-chosen, but because no single calling can employ and reward the varied\\ncapacities of male and female, old and young, robust and feeble. Thus a\\nlumbering or fishing region with us is apt to have a large proportion of\\nneedy inhabitants; and the same is true of a region exclusively devoted to\\ncotton growing or gold mining. A diversity of pursuits is indispensable to\\ngeneral activity and enduring prosperity.\\n\\nSixty or seventy years ago, what was then the District, and is now the\\nState, of Maine, was a proverb in New England for the poverty of its\\npeople, mainly because they were so largely engaged in timber cutting. The\\ngreat grain-growing, wheat-exporting districts of the Russian empire have\\na poor and rude people for a like reason. Thus the industry of\\nMassachusetts is immensely more productive per head than that of North\\nCarolina, or even that of Indiana, as it will cease to be whenever\\nmanufactures shall have been diffused over our whole country, as they must\\nand will be. In Massachusetts half the women and nearly half the children\\nadd by their daily labor to the aggregate of realized wealth; in North\\nCarolina and in Indiana little wealth is produced save by the labor of\\nmen, including boys of fifteen or upward. When this disparity shall have\\nceased, its consequence will also disappear.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: A chained man in prison reclining against the wall.

(401)\\n\\nEdwin Atherstone, 1788-1872, was born at Nottingham, England, and became\\nknown to the literary world chiefly through two poems, \"The Last Days of\\nHerculaneum\" and \"The Fall of Nineveh.\" Both poems are written in blank\\nverse, and are remarkable for their splendor of diction and their great\\ndescriptive power. Atherstone is compared to Thomson, whom he resembles\\nsomewhat in style.\\n###\\n\\n\\n                      There was a man,\\nA Roman soldier, for some daring deed\\nThat trespassed on the laws, in dungeon low\\nChained down. His was a noble spirit, rough,\\nBut generous, and brave, and kind.\\nHe had a son; it was a rosy boy,\\nA little faithful copy of his sire,\\nIn face and gesture. From infancy, the child\\nHad been his father\\'s solace and his care.\\n\\n                                     Every sport\\nThe father shared and heightened. But at length,\\nThe rigorous law had grasped him, and condemned\\nTo fetters and to darkness.\\n\\n                          The captive\\'s lot,\\nHe felt in all its bitterness: the walls\\nOf his deep dungeon answered many a sigh\\nAnd heart-heaved groan. His tale was known, and touched\\nHis jailer with compassion; and the boy,\\nThenceforth a frequent visitor, beguiled\\nHis father\\'s lingering hours, and brought a balm\\nWith his loved presence, that in every wound\\nDropped healing. But, in this terrific hour,\\nHe was a poisoned arrow in the breast\\nWhere he had been a cure.\\n\\n                       With earliest morn\\nOf that first day of darkness and amaze,\\nHe came. The iron door was closed--for them\\nNever to open more! The day, the night\\nDragged slowly by; nor did they know the fate\\nImpending o\\'er the city. Well they heard\\nThe pent-up thunders in the earth beneath,\\nAnd felt its giddy rocking; and the air\\nGrew hot at length, and thick; but in his straw\\nThe boy was sleeping: and the father hoped\\nThe earthquake might pass by: nor would he wake\\nFrom his sound rest the unfearing child, nor tell\\nThe dangers of their state.\\n\\n                             On his low couch\\nThe fettered soldier sank, and, with deep awe,\\nListened the fearful sounds: with upturned eye,\\nTo the great gods he breathed a prayer; then, strove\\nTo calm himself, and lose in sleep awhile\\nHis useless terrors. But he could not sleep:\\nHis body burned with feverish heat; his chains\\nClanked loud, although he moved not; deep in earth\\nGroaned unimaginable thunders; sounds,\\nFearful and ominous, arose and died,\\nLike the sad mornings of November\\'s wind,\\nIn the blank midnight. Deepest horror chilled\\nHis blood that burned before; cold, clammy sweats\\nCame o\\'er him; then anon, a fiery thrill\\nShot through his veins. Now, on his couch he shrunk\\nAnd shivered as in fear; now, upright leaped,\\nAs though he heard the battle trumpet sound,\\nAnd longed to cope with death.\\n\\n                           He slept, at last,\\nA troubled, dreamy sleep. Well had he slept\\nNever to waken more! His hours are few,\\nBut terrible his agony.\\n\\n                              Soon the storm\\nBurst forth; the lightnings glanced; the air\\nShook with the thunders. They awoke; they sprung\\nAmazed upon their feet. The dungeon glowed\\nA moment as in sunshine--and was dark:\\nAgain, a flood of white flame fills the cell,\\nDying away upon the dazzled eye\\nIn darkening, quivering tints, as stunning sound\\nDies throbbing, ringing in the ear.\\n\\n                                With intensest awe,\\nThe soldier\\'s frame was filled; and many a thought\\nOf strange foreboding hurried through his mind,\\nAs underneath he felt the fevered earth\\nJarring and lifting; and the massive walls,\\nHeard harshly grate and strain: yet knew he not,\\nWhile evils undefined and yet to come\\nGlanced through his thoughts, what deep and cureless wound\\nFate had already given.--Where, man of woe!\\nWhere, wretched father! is thy boy? Thou call\\'st\\nHis name in vain:--he can not answer thee.\\n\\nLoudly the father called upon his child:\\nNo voice replied. Trembling and anxiously\\nHe searched their couch of straw; with headlong haste\\nTrod round his stinted limits, and, low bent,\\nGroped darkling on the earth:--no child was there.\\nAgain he called: again, at farthest stretch\\nOf his accursed fetters, till the blood\\nSeemed bursting from his ears, and from his eyes\\nFire flashed, he strained with arm extended far,\\nAnd fingers widely spread, greedy to touch\\nThough but his idol\\'s garment. Useless toil!\\nYet still renewed: still round and round he goes,\\nAnd strains, and snatches, and with dreadful cries\\nCalls on his boy.\\n\\n                      Mad frenzy fires him now.\\nHe plants against the wall his feet; his chain\\nGrasps; tugs with giant strength to force away\\nThe deep-driven staple; yells and shrieks with rage:\\nAnd, like a desert lion in the snare,\\nRaging to break his toils,--to and fro bounds.\\nBut see! the ground is opening;--a blue light\\nMounts, gently waving,--noiseless;--thin and cold\\nIt seems, and like a rainbow tint, not flame;\\nBut by its luster, on the earth outstretched,\\nBehold the lifeless child! his dress is singed,\\nAnd, o\\'er his face serene, a darkened line\\nPoints out the lightning\\'s track.\\n\\n                                 The father saw,\\nAnd all his fury fled:--a dead calm fell\\nThat instant on him:--speechless--fixed--he stood,\\nAnd with a look that never wandered, gazed\\nIntensely on the corse. Those laughing eyes\\nWere not yet closed,--and round those ruby lips\\nThe wonted smile returned.\\n\\n                           Silent and pale\\nThe father stands:--no tear is in his eye:--\\nThe thunders bellow;--but he hears them not:--\\nThe ground lifts like a sea;--he knows it not:--\\nThe strong walls grind and gape:--the vaulted roof\\nTakes shape like bubble tossing in the wind;\\nSee! he looks up and smiles; for death to him\\nIs happiness. Yet could one last embrace\\nBe given, \\'t were still a sweeter thing to die.\\n\\nIt will be given. Look! how the rolling ground,\\nAt every swell, nearer and still more near\\nMoves toward the father\\'s outstretched arm his boy.\\nOnce he has touched his garment:--how his eye\\nLightens with love, and hope, and anxious fears!\\nHa, see! he has him now!--he clasps him round;\\nKisses his face; puts back the curling locks,\\nThat shaded his fine brow; looks in his eyes;\\nGrasps in his own those little dimpled hands;\\nThen folds him to his breast, as he was wont\\nTo lie when sleeping; and resigned, awaits\\nUndreaded death.\\n\\n                 And death came soon and swift\\nAnd pangless. The huge pile sank down at once\\nInto the opening earth. Walls--arches--roof--\\nAnd deep foundation stones--all--mingling--fell!\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Herculaneum and Pompeii were cities of Italy, which were destroyed\\nby an eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79 A. D., being entirely buried\\nunder ashes and lava. During the last century they have been dug out to a\\nconsiderable extent, and many of the streets, buildings, and utensils have\\nbeen found in a state of perfect preservation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXVI. HOW MEN REASON. (405)\\n\\nMy friend, the Professor, whom I have mentioned to you once or twice, told\\nme yesterday that somebody had been abusing him in some of the journals of\\nhis calling. I told him that I did n\\'t doubt he deserved it; that I hoped\\nhe did deserve a little abuse occasionally, and would for a number of\\nyears to come; that nobody could do anything to make his neighbors wiser\\nor better without being liable to abuse for it; especially that people\\nhated to have their little mistakes made fun of, and perhaps he had been\\ndoing something of the kind. The Professor smiled.\\n\\nNow, said I, hear what I am going to say. It will not take many years to\\nbring you to the period of life when men, at least the majority of writing\\nand talking men, do nothing but praise. Men, like peaches and pears, grow\\nsweet a little while before they begin to decay. I don\\'t know what it\\nis,--whether a spontaneous change, mental or bodily, or whether it is\\nthrough experience of the thanklessness of critical honesty,--but it is a\\nfact, that most writers, except sour and unsuccessful ones, get tired of\\nfinding fault at about the time when they are beginning to grow old.\\n\\nAs a general thing, I would not give a great deal for the fair words of a\\ncritic, if he is himself an author, over fifty years of age. At thirty, we\\nare all trying to cut our names in big letters upon the walls of this\\ntenement of life; twenty years later, we have carved it, or shut up our\\njackknives. Then we are ready to help others, and care less to hinder any,\\nbecause nobody\\'s elbows are in our way. So I am glad you have a little\\nlife left; you will be saccharine enough in a few years.\\n\\nSome of the softening effects of advancing age have struck me very much in\\nwhat I have heard or seen here and elsewhere. I just now spoke of the\\nsweetening process that authors undergo. Do you know that in the gradual\\npassage from maturity to helplessness the harshest characters sometimes\\nhave a period in which they are gentle and placid as young children? I\\nhave heard it said, but I can not be sponsor for its truth, that the\\nfamous chieftain, Lochiel, was rocked in a cradle like a baby, in his old\\nage. An old man, whose studies had been of the severest scholastic kind,\\nused to love to hear little nursery stories read over and over to him. One\\nwho saw the Duke of Wellington in his last years describes him as very\\ngentle in his aspect and demeanor. I remember a person of singularly\\nstern and lofty bearing who became remarkably gracious and easy in all his\\nways in the later period of his life.\\n\\nAnd that leads me to say that men often remind me of pears in their way of\\ncoming to maturity. Some are ripe at twenty, like human Jargonelles, and\\nmust be made the most of, for their day is soon over. Some come into their\\nperfect condition late, like the autumn kinds, and they last better than\\nthe summer fruit. And some, that, like the Winter Nelis, have been hard\\nand uninviting until all the rest have had their season, get their glow\\nand perfume long after the frost and snow have done their worst with the\\norchards. Beware of rash criticisms; the rough and stringent fruit you\\ncondemn may be an autumn or a winter pear, and that which you picked up\\nbeneath the same bough in August may have been only its worm--eaten\\nwindfalls. Milton was a Saint Germain with a graft of the roseate Early\\nCatherine. Rich, juicy, lively, fragrant, russet-skinned old Chaucer was\\nan Easter Beurre\\'; the buds of a new summer were swelling when he ripened.\\n\\n                                                               --Holmes.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The above selection is from the \"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table.\"\\n\\nLochiel. See note on page 214.\\n\\nThe Duke of Wellington (b. 1769, d. 1852) was the most celebrated of\\nEnglish generals. He won great renown in India and in the \"Peninsular\\nWar,\" and commanded the allied forces when Napoleon was defeated at\\nWaterloo.\\n\\nEaster Beurre\\', Saint Germain, Winter Nelis, Early Catherine and\\nJargonelles are the names of certain varieties of pears.\\n\\nMilton. See biographical notice on page 312.\\n\\nChaucer, Geoffrey (b. 1328, d. 1400). is often called \"The Father of\\nEnglish Poetry.\" He was the first poet buried in Westminster Abbey. He was\\na prolific writer, but his \"Canterbury Tales\" is by far the best known of\\nhis works.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXVII. THUNDERSTORM ON THE ALPS. (408)\\n\\n  Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,\\n  With the wild world I dwell in, is a thing\\n  Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake\\n  Earth\\'s troubled waters for a purer spring.\\n  This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing\\n  To waft me from distraction; once I loved\\n  Torn ocean\\'s roar, but thy soft murmuring\\n  Sounds sweet, as if a sister\\'s voice reproved,\\nThat I with stern delights should e\\'er have been so moved.\\n\\n  All heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,\\n  But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;\\n  And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep--\\n  All heaven and earth are still: from the high host\\n  Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain coast,\\n  All is concentered in a life intense,\\n  Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,\\n  But hath a part of being, and a sense\\nOf that which is of all Creator and defense.\\n\\n  The sky is changed! and such a change! O night,\\n  And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,\\n  Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light\\n  Of a dark eye in woman! Far along,\\n  From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,\\n  Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,\\n  But every mountain now hath found a tongue,\\n  And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,\\n  Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!\\n\\n  And this is in the night.--Most glorious night!\\n  Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be\\n  A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--\\n  A portion of the tempest and of thee!\\n  How the lit lake shines,--a phosphoric sea!\\n  And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!\\n  And now again, \\'tis black,--and now, the glee\\n  Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,\\nAs if they did rejoice o\\'er a young earthquake\\'s birth.\\n\\n  Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between\\n  Heights which appear as lovers who have parted\\n  In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,\\n  That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;\\n  Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,\\n  Love was the very root of the fond rage,\\n  Which blighted their life\\'s bloom, and then--departed.\\n  Itself expired, but leaving them an age\\nOf years, all winters,--war within themselves to wage.\\n\\n  Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,\\n  The mightiest of the storms hath ta\\'en his stand!\\n  For here, not one, but many make their play,\\n  And fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,\\n  Flashing and cast around! Of all the band,\\n  The brightest through these parted hills hath forked\\n  His lightnings,--as if he did understand,\\n  That in such gaps as desolation worked,\\nThere, the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.\\n                                                          --Byron.\\n\\nNOTE.--Lake Leman (or Lake of Geneva) is in the south-western part of\\nSwitzerland, separating it in part from Savoy. The Rhone flows through it,\\nentering by a deep narrow gap, with mountain groups on either hand, eight\\nor nine thousand feet above the water. The scenery about the lake is\\nmagnificent, the Jura mountains bordering it on the northwest, and the\\nAlps lying on the south and east.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXVIII. ORIGIN OF PROPERTY. (410)\\n\\nSir William Blackstone, 1723-1780, was the son of a silk merchant, and was\\nborn in London. He studied with great success at Oxford, and was admitted\\nto the bar in 1745. At first he could not obtain business enough in his\\nprofession to support himself, and for a time relinquished practice, and\\nlectured at Oxford. He afterwards returned to London, and resumed his\\npractice with great success, still continuing to lecture at Oxford. He was\\nelected to Parliament in 1761; and in 1770 was made a justice of the Court\\nof Common Pleas, which office he held till his death. Blackstone\\'s fame\\nrests upon his \"Commentaries on the Laws of England,\" published about\\n1769. He was a man of great ability, sound learning, unflagging industry,\\nand moral integrity. His great work is still a common text-book in the\\nstudy of law.\\n###\\n\\n\\nIn the beginning of the world, we are informed by Holy Writ, the all-\\nbountiful Creator gave to man dominion over all the earth, and \"over the\\nfish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing\\nthat moveth upon the earth.\" This is the only true and solid foundation of\\nman\\'s dominion over external things, whatever airy, metaphysical notions\\nmay have been started by fanciful writers upon this subject. The earth,\\ntherefore, and all things therein, are the general property of all\\nmankind, exclusive of other beings, from the immediate gift of the\\nCreator. And while the earth continued bare of inhabitants, it is\\nreasonable to suppose that all was in common among them, and that everyone\\ntook from the public stock, to his own use, such things as his immediate\\nnecessities required.\\n\\nThese general notions of property were then sufficient to answer all the\\npurposes of human life; and might, perhaps, still have answered them, had\\nit been possible for mankind to have remained in a state of primeval\\nsimplicity, in which \"all things were common to him.\" Not that this\\ncommunion of goods seems ever to have been applicable, even in the\\nearliest ages, to aught but the substance of the thing; nor could it be\\nextended to the use of it. For, by the law of nature and reason, he who\\nfirst began to use it, acquired therein a kind of transient property, that\\nlasted so long as he was using it, and no longer. Or, to speak with\\ngreater precision, the right of possession continued for the same time,\\nonly, that the act of possession lasted.\\n\\nThus, the ground was in common, and no part of it was the permanent\\nproperty of any man in particular; yet, whoever was in the occupation of\\nany determined spot of it, for rest, for shade, or the like, acquired for\\nthe time a sort of ownership, from which it would have been unjust and\\ncontrary to the law of nature to have driven him by force; but, the\\ninstant that he quitted the use or occupation of it, another might seize\\nit without injustice. Thus, also, a vine or other tree might be said to be\\nin common, as all men were equally entitled to its produce; and yet, any\\nprivate individual might gain the sole property of the fruit which he had\\ngathered for his own repast: a doctrine well illustrated by Cicero, who\\ncompares the world to a great theater, which is common to the public, and\\nyet the place which any man has taken is, for the time, his own.\\n\\nBut when mankind increased in number, craft, and ambition, it became\\nnecessary to entertain conceptions of a more permanent dominion; and to\\nappropriate to individuals not the immediate use only, but the very\\nsubstance of the thing to be used. Otherwise, innumerable tumults must\\nhave arisen, and the good order of the world been continually broken and\\ndisturbed, while a variety of persons were striving who should get the\\nfirst occupation of the same thing, or disputing which of them had\\nactually gained it. As human life also grew more and more refined,\\nabundance of conveniences were devised to render it more easy, commodious,\\nand agreeable; as habitations for shelter and safety, and raiment for\\nwarmth and decency. But no man would be at the trouble to provide either,\\nso long as he had only a usufructuary property in them, which was to cease\\nthe instant that he quitted possession; if, as soon as he walked out of\\nhis tent or pulled off his garment, the next stranger who came by would\\nhave a right to inhabit the one and to wear the other.\\n\\nIn the case of habitations, in particular, it was natural to observe that\\neven the brute creation, to whom everything else was in common, maintained\\na kind of permanent property in their dwellings, especially for the\\nprotection of their young; that the birds of the air had nests, and the\\nbeasts of the fields had caverns, the invasion of which they esteemed a\\nvery flagrant injustice, and would sacrifice their lives to preserve them.\\nHence a property was soon established in every man\\'s house and homestead;\\nwhich seem to have been originally mere temporary huts or movable cabins,\\nsuited to the design of Providence for more speedily peopling the earth,\\nand suited to the wandering life of their owners, before any extensive\\nproperty in the soil or ground was established.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt but that movables of every kind became sooner\\nappropriated than the permanent, substantial soil; partly because they\\nwere more susceptible of a long occupancy, which might be continue for\\nmonths together without any sensible interruption, and at length, by\\nusage, ripen into an established right; but, principally, because few of\\nthem could be fit for use till improved and meliorated by the bodily labor\\nof the occupant; which bodily labor, bestowed upon any subject which\\nbefore lay in common to all men, is universally allowed to give the\\nfairest and most reasonable title to an exclusive property therein.\\n\\nThe article of food was a more immediate call, and therefore a more early\\nconsideration. Such as were not contented with the spontaneous product of\\nthe earth, sought for a more solid refreshment in the flesh of beasts,\\nwhich they obtained by hunting. But the frequent disappointments incident\\nto that method of provision, induced them to gather together such animals\\nas were of a more tame and sequacious nature and to establish themselves\\nin a less precarious manner, partly by the milk of the dams, and partly by\\nthe flesh of the young.\\n\\nThe support of these their cattle made the article of water also a very\\nimportant point. And, therefore, the book of Genesis, (the most venerable\\nmonument of antiquity, considered merely with a view to history,) will\\nfurnish us with frequent instances of violent contentions concerning\\nwells; the exclusive property of which appears to have been established in\\nthe first digger or occupant, even in places where the ground and herbage\\nremained yet in common. Thus, we find Abraham, who was but a sojourner,\\nasserting his right to a well in the country of Abimelech, and exacting an\\noath for his security \"because he had digged that well.\" And Isaac, about\\nninety years afterwards, reclaimed this his father\\'s property; and, after\\nmuch contention with the Philistines, was suffered to enjoy it in peace.\\n\\nAll this while, the soil and pasture of the earth remained still in common\\nas before, and open to every occupant; except, perhaps, in the\\nneighborhood of towns, where the necessity of a sale and exclusive\\nproperty in lands, (for the sake of agriculture,) was earlier felt, and\\ntherefore more readily complied with. Otherwise, when the multitude of men\\nand cattle had consumed every convenience on one spot of ground, it was\\ndeemed a natural right to seize upon and occupy such other lands as would\\nmore easily supply their necessities.\\n\\nWe have a striking example of this in the history of Abraham and his\\nnephew Lot. When their joint substance became so great that pasture and\\nother conveniences grew scarce, the natural consequence was that a strife\\narose between their servants; so that it was no longer practicable to\\ndwell together. This contention, Abraham thus endeavored to compose: \"Let\\nthere be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee. Is not the whole\\nland before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wilt\\ntake the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the\\nright hand, then I will go to the left.\" This plainly implies an\\nacknowledged right in either to occupy whatever ground he pleased that was\\nnot preoccupied by other tribes. \"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld\\nall the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, even as the\\ngarden of the Lord. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, and\\njourneyed east; and Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan.\"\\n\\nAs the world by degrees grew more populous, it daily became more difficult\\nto find out new spots to inhabit, without encroaching upon former\\noccupants; and, by constantly occupying the same individual spot, the\\nfruits of the earth were consumed, and its spontaneous products destroyed\\nwithout any provision for future supply or succession. It, therefore,\\nbecame necessary to pursue some regular method of providing a constant\\nsubsistence; and this necessity produced, or at least promoted and\\nencouraged the art of agriculture. And the art of agriculture, by a\\nregular connection and consequence, introduced and established the idea of\\na more permanent property in the soil than had hitherto been received and\\nadopted.\\n\\nIt was clear that the earth would not produce her fruits in sufficient\\nquantities without the assistance of tillage; but who would be at the\\npains of tilling it, if another might watch an opportunity to seize upon\\nand enjoy the product of his industry, art and labor? Had not, therefore,\\na separate property in lands, as well as movables, been vested in some\\nindividuals, the world must have continued a forest, and men have been\\nmere animals of prey. Whereas, now, (so graciously has Providence\\ninterwoven our duty and our happiness together,) the result of this very\\nnecessity has been the ennobling of the human species, by giving it\\nopportunities of improving its rational, as well as of exerting its\\nnatural faculties.\\n\\nNecessity begat property; and, in order to insure that property, recourse\\nwas had to civil society, which brought along with it a long train of\\ninseparable concomitants: states, government, laws, punishments, and the\\npublic exercise of religious duties. Thus connected together, it was found\\nthat a part only of society was sufficient to provide, by their manual\\nlabor, for the necessary subsistence of all; and leisure was given to\\nothers to cultivate the human mind, to invent useful arts, and to lay the\\nfoundations of science.\\n\\nNOTE.--Cicero.

(415)\\n\\n  There was a sound of revelry by night,\\n  And Belgium\\'s capital had gathered then\\n  Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright\\n  The lamps shone o\\'er fair women and brave men.\\n  A thousand hearts beat happily; and when\\n  Music arose with its voluptuous swell,\\n  Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,\\n  And all went merry as a marriage bell;\\nBut hush! hark!--a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\\n\\n  Did ye not hear it?--No; \\'t was but the wind,\\n  Or the car rattling o\\'er the stony street;\\n  On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;\\n  No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\\n  To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--\\n  But, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once mere,\\n  As if the clouds its echo would repeat,\\n  And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\\nArm! arm! it is--it is the cannon\\'s opening roar!\\n\\n  Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,\\n  And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\\n  And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago\\n  Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;\\n  And there were sudden partings, such as press\\n  The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\\n  Which ne\\'er might be repeated: who could guess\\n  If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\\nSince upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise.\\n\\n  And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,\\n  The mustering squadron, and the clattering car\\n  Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,\\n  And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\\n  And the deep thunder, peal on peal afar;\\n  And near, the beat of the alarming drum\\n  Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;\\n  While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,\\n  Or whispering with white lips--\"The foe! They come!\\nThey come!\"\\n\\n  And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,\\n  Dewy with nature\\'s tear-drops, as they pass,\\n  Grieving, if aught inanimate e\\'er grieves,\\n  Over the unreturning brave!--alas!\\n  Ere evening to be trodden like the grass,\\n  Which, now, beneath them, but above, shall grow,\\n  In its next verdure, when this fiery mass\\n  Of living valor, rolling on the foe,\\nAnd burning with high hope, shall molder, cold and low\\n\\n  Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,\\n  Last eve in beauty\\'s circle proudly gay,\\n  The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,\\n  The morn, the marshaling in arms,--the day,\\n  Battle\\'s magnificently stern array!\\n  The thunderclouds close o\\'er it, which when rent,\\n  The earth is covered thick with other clay,\\n  Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,\\nRider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent.\\n                                                        --Byron.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--The Battle of Waterloo was fought on June 18th, 1815, between the\\nFrench army on one side, commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, and the English\\narmy and allies on the other side, commanded by the Duke of Wellington. At\\nthe commencement of the battle, some of the officers were at a ball at\\nBrussels, a short distance from Waterloo, and being notified of the\\napproaching contest by the cannonade, left the ballroom for the field of\\nbattle.\\n\\nThe wood of Soignies lay between the field of Waterloo and Brussels. It is\\nsupposed to be a remnant of the forest of Ardennes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXX. \"WITH BRAINS, SIR.\" (417)\\n\\nJohn Brown, 1810-1882, was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and graduated at\\nthe University of Edinburgh. His father was John Brown, an eminent\\nclergyman and the author of several books. Dr. Brown\\'s literary reputation\\nrests largely upon a series of papers contributed to the \"North British\\nReview.\" \"Rab and his Friends,\" a collection of papers published in book\\nform, is the most widely known of all his writings.\\n###\\n\\n\\n\"Pray, Mr. Opie, may I ask you what you mix your colors with?\" said a\\nbrisk dilettante student to the great painter. \"With brains, sir,\" was the\\ngruff reply--and the right one. It did not give much of information; it\\ndid not expound the principles and rules of the art; but, if the inquirer\\nhad the commodity referred to, it would awaken him; it would set him\\nagoing, athinking, and a-painting to good purpose. If he had not the\\nwherewithal, as was likely enough, the less he had to do with colors and\\ntheir mixture the better.\\n\\nMany other artists, when asked such a question, would have either set\\nabout detailing the mechanical composition of such and such colors, in\\nsuch and such proportions, rubbed up so and so; or perhaps they would (and\\nso much the better, but not the best) have shown him how they laid them\\non; but even this would leave him at the critical point. Opie preferred\\ngoing to the quick and the heart of the matter: \"With brains, sir.\"\\n\\nSir Joshua Reynolds was taken by a friend to see a picture. He was\\nanxious to admire it, and he looked it over with a keen and careful but\\nfavorable eye. \"Capital composition; correct drawing; the color, tone,\\nchiaroscuro excellent; but--but--it wants--hang it, it wants--that!\"\\nsnapping his fingers; and, wanting \"that,\" though it had everything else,\\nit was worth nothing.\\n\\nAgain, Etty was appointed teacher of the students of the Royal Academy,\\nhaving been preceded by a clever, talkative, scientific expounder of\\naesthetics, who delighted to tell the young men how everything was done,\\nhow to copy this, and how to express that. A student came up to the new\\nmaster, \"How should I do this, sir?\" \"Suppose you try.\" Another, \"What\\ndoes this mean, Mr. Etty?\" \"Suppose you look.\" \"But I have looked.\"\\n\"Suppose you look again.\"\\n\\nAnd they did try, and they did look, and looked again; and they saw and\\nachieved what they never could have done had the how or the what\\n(supposing this possible, which it is not, in full and highest meaning)\\nbeen told them, or done for them; in the one case, sight and action were\\nimmediate, exact, intense, and secure; in the other, mediate, feeble, and\\nlost as soon as gained.\\n\\nNOTES.--Opie, John (b. 1761, d. 1807), was born in Wales, and was known as\\nthe \"Cornish wonder.\" He became celebrated as a portrait painter, but\\nafterwards devoted himself to historical subjects.

THE NEW ENGLAND PASTOR. (419)\\n\\nTimothy Dwight, 1752-1817, was born at Northampton, Massachusetts. His\\nmother was a daughter of the celebrated Jonathan Edwards. It is said that\\nshe taught her son the alphabet in one lesson, that he could read the\\nBible at four years of age, and that he studied Latin by himself at six.\\nHe graduated at Yale in 1769, returned as tutor in 1771, and continued six\\nyears. He was chaplain in a brigade under General Putnam for a time. In\\n1778 his father died, and for five years he supported his mother and a\\nfamily of twelve children by farming, teaching and preaching. From 1783 to\\n1795 he was pastor at Greenfield, Connecticut. He was then chosen\\nPresident of Yale College, and remained in office till he died. Dr. Dwight\\nwas a man of fine bodily presence, of extended learning, and untiring\\nindustry. His presidency of the college was highly successful. His\\npatriotism was no less ardent and true than his piety. In his younger days\\nhe wrote considerably in verse. His poetry is not all of a very high\\norder, but some pieces possess merit.\\n###\\n\\n\\n  The place, with east and western sides,\\nA wide and verdant street divides:\\nAnd here the houses faced the day,\\nAnd there the lawns in beauty lay.\\nThere, turret-crowned, and central, stood\\nA neat and solemn house of God.\\nAcross the way, beneath the shade\\nTwo elms with sober silence spread,\\nThe preacher lived.

DEATH OF ABSALOM. (420)\\n\\nDavid numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of\\nthousands and captains of hundreds over them. And David sent forth a third\\npart of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand\\nof Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, Joab\\'s brother, and a third part under the\\nhand of Ittai, the Gittite.\\n\\nAnd the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself\\nalso. But the people answered, thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee\\naway, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care\\nfor us; but now thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is\\nbetter that thou succor us out of the city. And the king said unto them,\\nWhat seemeth you best, I will do.\\n\\nAnd the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by\\nhundreds and by thousands. And the king commanded Joab, and Abishai, and\\nIttai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with\\nAbsalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains\\ncharge concerning Absalom.\\n\\nSo the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was\\nin the wood of Ephraim; where the people of Israel were slain before the\\nservants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of\\ntwenty thousand men. For the battle was there scattered over the face of\\nall the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword\\ndevoured.\\n\\nAnd Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and\\nthe mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught\\nhold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and\\nthe mule that was under him went away.\\n\\nAnd a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom\\nhanged in an oak. And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold,\\nthou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and\\nI would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle. And the man\\nsaid unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my\\nhand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king\\'s son; for, in\\nour hearing, the king charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Beware\\nthat none touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise, I should have wrought\\nfalsehood against mine own life; for there is no matter hid from the king,\\nand thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against me.\\n\\nThen said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in\\nhis hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet\\nalive in the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare Joab\\'s armor,\\ncompassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. And Joab blew the\\ntrumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held\\nback the people.\\n\\nAnd they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid\\na very great heap of stones upon him; and all Israel fled, everyone to his\\ntent. Now Absalom, in his lifetime, had taken and reared up for himself a\\npillar, which is in the king\\'s dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my\\nname in remembrance; and he called the pillar after his own name; and it\\nis called unto this day, Absalom\\'s Place.\\n\\nThen said Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king\\ntidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies. And Joab said\\nunto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear\\ntidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the\\nking\\'s son is dead. Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou\\nhast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.\\n\\nThen said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let\\nme, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou\\nrun, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? But howsoever, said\\nhe, let me run. And he said unto him, run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of\\nthe plain, and overran Cushi.\\n\\nAnd David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof\\nover the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and\\nbehold, a man running alone. And the watchman cried, and told the king.\\nAnd the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he\\ncame apace, and drew near.\\n\\nAnd the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called unto the\\nporter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He\\nalso bringeth tidings. And the watchman said, Methinketh the running of\\nthe foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king\\nsaid, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.\\n\\nAnd Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down\\nto the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord\\nthy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against\\nmy lord the king. And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And\\nAhimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king\\'s servant, and me thy servant, I\\nsaw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. And the king said unto\\nhim, Turn aside and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.\\n\\nAnd behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings my lord the king; for the\\nLord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. And\\nthe king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi\\nanswered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee\\nto do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\\n\\nAnd the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and\\nwept; and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom! my son, my son\\nAbsalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\\n                                                 --II Samuel, Chap. xviii.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXIII. ABRAHAM DAVENPORT. (424)\\n\\n\\'T was on a May day of the far old year\\nSeventeen hundred eighty, that there fell\\nOver the bloom and sweet life of the Spring,\\nOver the fresh earth and the heaven of noon,\\nA horror of great darkness, like the night\\nIn day of which the Norland sagas tell,\\nThe Twilight of the Gods.\\n\\n                          The low-hung sky\\nWas black with ominous clouds, save where its rim\\nWas fringed with a dull glow, like that which climbs\\nThe crater\\'s sides from the red hell below.\\nBirds ceased to sing, and all the barnyard fowls\\nRoosted; the cattle at the pasture bars\\nLowed, and looked homeward; bats on leathern wings\\nFlitted abroad; the sounds of labor died;\\nMen prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp\\nTo hear the doom blast of the trumpet shatter\\nThe black sky, that the dreadful face of Christ\\nMight look from the rent clouds, not as he looked\\nA loving guest at Bethany, but stern\\nAs Justice and inexorable Law.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the old Statehouse, dim as ghosts,\\nSat the lawgivers of Connecticut,\\nTrembling beneath their legislative robes.\\n\"It is the Lord\\'s Great Day! Let us adjourn,\"\\nSome said; and then, as if with one accord,\\nAll eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport.\\n\\nHe rose, slow-cleaving with his steady voice\\nThe intolerable hush. \"This well may be\\nThe Day of Judgment which the world awaits;\\nBut be it so or not, I only know\\nMy present duty, and my Lord\\'s command\\nTo occupy till he come. So at the post\\nWhere he hath set me in his providence,\\nI choose, for one, to meet him face to face,\\nNo faithless servant frightened from my task,\\nBut ready when the Lord of the harvest calls;\\nAnd therefore, with all reverence, I would say,\\nLet God do his work, we will see to ours.\\nBring in the candles.\" And they brought them in.\\n\\nThen by the flaring lights the Speaker read,\\nAlbeit with husky voice and shaking hands,\\nAn act to amend an act to regulate\\nThe shad and alewive fisheries. Whereupon,\\nWisely and well spake Abraham Davenport,\\nStraight to the question, with no figures of speech\\nSave the ten Arab signs, yet not without\\nThe shrewd, dry humor natural to the man:\\nHis awe-struck colleagues listening all the while,\\nBetween the pauses of his argument,\\nTo hear the thunder of the wrath of God\\nBreak from the hollow trumpet of the cloud.\\n\\nAnd there he stands in memory to this day,\\nErect, self-poised, a rugged face, half seen\\nAgainst the background of unnatural dark,\\nA witness to the ages as they pass,\\nThat simple duty hath no place for fear.\\n                                             --Whittier.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The \"Dark Day,\" as it is known, occurred May 19th, 1780, and\\nextended over all New England. The darkness came on about ten o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, and lasted with varying degrees of intensity until midnight\\nof the next day. The cause of the phenomenon is unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXIV. THE FALLS OF THE YOSEMITE. (426)\\n\\nThomas Starr King, 1824-1863, was born in New York City. His father was a\\nUniversalist minister; and, in 1834, he settled in Charlestown,\\nMassachusetts. The son was preparing to enter Harvard University, when the\\ndeath of his father devolved upon him the support of his mother, and his\\ncollegiate course had to be given up. He spent several years as clerk and\\nteacher, improving meanwhile all possible opportunities for study. In 1846\\nhe was settled over the church to which his father had preached in\\nCharlestown. Two years later, he was called to the Hollis Street Unitarian\\nChurch in Boston. Here his eloquence and active public spirit soon made\\nhim well known. He also gained much reputation as a public lecturer. In\\n1860 he left the East to take charge of the Unitarian church in San\\nFrancisco. During the remaining years of his life, he exercised much\\ninfluence in the public affairs of California. He died suddenly, of\\ndiphtheria, in the midst of his brilliant career.\\n\\nMr. King was a great lover of nature. His \"White Hills,\" describing the\\nmountain scenery of New Hampshire, is the most complete book ever written\\nconcerning that interesting region.\\n###\\n\\nThe Yosemite valley, in California, is a pass about ten miles long. At its\\neastern extremity it leads into three narrower passes, each of which\\nextends several miles, winding by the wildest paths into the heart of the\\nSierra Nevada chain of mountains. For seven miles of the main valley,\\nwhich varies in width from three quarters of a mile to a mile and a half,\\nthe walls on either side are from two thousand to nearly five thousand\\nfeet above the road, and are nearly perpendicular. From these walls, rocky\\nsplinters a thousand feet in height start up, and every winter drop a few\\nhundred tons of granite, to adorn the base of the rampart with picturesque\\nruin.\\n\\nThe valley is of such irregular width, and bends so much and often so\\nabruptly, that there is a great variety and frequent surprise in the forms\\nand combinations of the overhanging rocks as one rides along the bank of\\nthe stream. The patches of luxuriant meadow, with their dazzling green,\\nand the grouping of the superb firs, two hundred feet high, that skirt\\nthem, and that shoot above the stout and graceful oaks and sycamores\\nthrough which the horse path winds, are delightful rests of sweetness and\\nbeauty amid the threatening awfulness.\\n\\nThe Merced, which flows through the same pass, is a noble stream, a\\nhundred feet wide and ten feet deep. It is formed chiefly of the streams\\nthat leap and rush through the narrower passes, and it is swollen, also,\\nby the bounty of the marvelous waterfalls that pour down from the ramparts\\nof the wider valley. The sublime poetry of Habakkuk is needed to describe\\nthe impression, and, perhaps, the geology, of these mighty fissures: \"Thou\\ndidst cleave the earth with rivers.\"\\n\\nAt the foot of the breakneck declivity of nearly three thousand feet by\\nwhich we reach the banks of the Merced, we are six miles from the hotel,\\nand every rod of the ride awakens wonder, awe, and a solemn joy. As we\\napproach the hotel, and turn toward the opposite bank of the river, what\\nis that\\n\\n    \"Which ever sounds and shines,\\n    A pillar of white light upon the wall\\n    Of purple cliffs aloof descried\"?\\n\\nThat, reader, is the highest waterfall in the world--the Yosemite\\ncataract, nearly twenty-five hundred feet in its plunge, dashing from a\\nbreak or depression in a cliff thirty-two hundred feet sheer.\\n\\nA writer who visited this valley in September, calls the cataract a mere\\ntape line of water dropped from the sky. Perhaps it is so, toward the\\nclose of the dry season; but as we saw it, the blended majesty and beauty\\nof it, apart from the general sublimities of Yosemite gorge, would repay a\\njourney of a thousand miles. There was no deficiency of water. It was a\\npowerful stream, thirty-five feet broad, fresh from the Nevada, that made\\nthe plunge from the brow of the awful precipice.\\n\\nAt the first leap it clears fourteen hundred and ninety-seven feet; then\\nit tumbles down a series of steep stairways four hundred and two feet, and\\nthen makes a jump to the meadows five hundred and eighteen feet more. But\\nit is the upper and highest cataract that is most wonderful to the eye, as\\nwell as most musical. The cliff is so sheer that there is no break in the\\nbody of the water during the whole of its descent of more than a quarter\\nof a mile. It pours in a curve from the summit, fifteen hundred feet, to\\nthe basin that hoards it but a moment for the cascades that follow.\\n\\nAnd what endless complexities and opulence of beauty in the forms and\\nmotions of the cataract! It is comparatively narrow at the top of the\\nprecipice, although, as we said, the tide that pours over is thirty-five\\nfeet broad. But it widens as it descends, and curves a little on one side\\nas it widens, so that it shapes itself, before it reaches its first bowl\\nof granite, into the figure of a comet. More beautiful than the comet,\\nhowever, we can see the substance of this watery loveliness ever renew\\nitself and ever pour itself away.\\n\\n  \"It mounts in spray the skies, and thence again\\n    Returns in an unceasing shower, which round\\n  With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,\\n    Is an eternal April to the ground,\\n    Making it all one emerald;--how profound\\n  The gulf! and how the giant element\\n    From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,\\n  Crushing the cliffs.\"\\n\\nThe cataract seems to shoot out a thousand serpentine heads or knots of\\nwater, which wriggle down deliberately through the air and expend\\nthemselves in mist before half the descent is over. Then a new set burst\\nfrom the body and sides of the fall, with the same fortune on the\\nremaining distance; and thus the most charming fretwork of watery nodules,\\neach trailing its vapory train for a hundred feet or more, is woven all\\nover the cascade, which swings, now and then, thirty feet each way, on the\\nmountain side, as if it were a pendulum of watery lace. Once in a while,\\ntoo, the wind manages to get back of the fall, between it and the cliff,\\nand then it will whirl it round and round for two or three hundred feet,\\nas if to try the experiment of twisting it to wring it dry.\\n\\nOf course I visited the foot of the lowest fall of the Yosemite, and\\nlooked up through the spray, five hundred feet, to its crown. And I tried\\nto climb to the base of the first or highest cataract, but lost my way\\namong the steep, sharp rocks, for there is only one line by which the\\ncliff can be scaled. But no nearer view that I found or heard described,\\nis comparable with the picture, from the hotel, of the comet curve of the\\nupper cataract, fifteen hundred feet high, and the two falls immediately\\nbeneath it, in which the same water leaps to the level of the quiet\\nMerced.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXV. A PSALM OF LIFE. (429)\\n\\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\\n  Life is but an empty dream!\\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers,\\n  And things are not what they seem.\\n\\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\\n  And the grave is not its goal;\\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\\n  Was not spoken of the soul.\\n\\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\\n  Is our destined end or way;\\nBut to act, that each to-morrow\\n  Find us farther than to-day.\\n\\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting,\\n  And our hearts, though stout and brave,\\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating\\n  Funeral marches to the grave.\\n\\nIn the world\\'s broad field of battle,\\n  In the bivouac of Life,\\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle!\\n  Be a hero in the strife!\\n\\nTrust no Future, howe\\'er pleasant!\\n  Let the dead Past bury its dead!\\nAct--act in the living Present!\\n  Heart within, and God o\\'erhead.\\n\\nLives of great men all remind us\\n  We can make our lives sublime,\\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\\n  Footprints on the sands of time;--\\n\\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\\n  Sailing o\\'er life\\'s solemn main,\\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\\n  Seeing, shall take heart again.\\n\\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\\n  With a heart for any fate;\\n  Still achieving, still pursuing,\\nLearn to labor and to wait.\\n                                  --Longfellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXVI. FRANKLIN\\'S ENTRY INTO PHILADELPHIA. (431)\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin, 1706-1790, was born in Boston. He received little\\nschooling, but being apprenticed to his brother, a printer, he acquired a\\ntaste for reading and study. In 1723, he went to Philadelphia, where he\\nfollowed his chosen calling, and in time became the publisher of the\\n\"Pennsylvania Gazette\" and the celebrated \"Poor Richard\\'s Almanac.\"\\n\\nAs a philosopher Franklin was rendered famous by his discovery of the\\nidentity of lightning with electricity. His career in public affairs may\\nbe briefly summarized as follows: In 1736 he was made Clerk of the\\nProvincial Assembly; in 1737, deputy postmaster at Philadelphia; and in\\n1753, Postmaster general for British America. He was twice in England as\\nthe agent of certain colonies. After signing the Declaration of\\nIndependence, he was sent as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in 1776.\\nOn his return, in 1785, he was made \"President of the Commonwealth of\\nPennsylvania,\" holding the office three years. He was also one of the\\nframers of the Constitution of the United States.\\n\\nAs a writer Franklin commenced his career when only twelve years old by\\ncomposing two ballads, which, however, he condemned as \"wretched stuff.\"\\nFranklin\\'s letters and papers on electricity, afterwards enlarged by\\nessays on various philosophical subjects, have been translated into Latin,\\nFrench, Italian, and German. The most noted of his works, and the one from\\nwhich the following extract is taken, is his \"Autobiography.\" This book is\\n\"one of the half dozen most widely popular books ever printed,\" and has\\nbeen published in nearly every written language. Franklin founded the\\nAmerican Philosophical Society, and established an institution which has\\nsince grown into the University of Pennsylvania. His life is a noble\\nexample of the results of industry and perseverance, and his death was the\\noccasion of public mourning.\\n###\\n\\n\\nWalking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I\\nfound was going towards Philadelphia, with several people in her. They\\ntook me in, and, as there was no wind, we rowed all the way; and about\\nmidnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confident\\nwe must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not\\nwhere we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near\\nan old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being\\ncold, in October, and there we remained till daylight.\\n\\nThen one of the company knew the place to be Cooper\\'s Creek, a little\\nabove Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and\\narrived there about eight or nine o\\'clock on the Sunday morning, and\\nlanded at the Market Street wharf.\\n\\nI have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and\\nshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your mind\\ncompare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made there.\\n\\nI was in my working dress, my best clothes being to come round by sea. I\\nwas dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuffed out with shirts and\\nstockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging. I was\\nfatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest; I was very hungry; and\\nmy whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and about a shilling\\nin copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for my passage, who at\\nfirst refused it on account of my rowing; but I insisted on their taking\\nit,--a man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money\\nthan when he has plenty, perhaps through fear of being thought to have but\\nlittle.\\n\\nThen I walked up the street gazing about, till, near the market house, I\\nmet a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring\\nwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker\\'s he directed me to, in\\nSecond Street, and asked for biscuit, intending such as we had in Boston:\\nbut they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a\\nthreepenny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not considering or\\nknowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names\\nof his bread, I bade him give threepenny worth of any sort. He gave me,\\naccordingly, three great puffy rolls. I was surprised at the quantity, but\\ntook it, and, having no room in my pockets, walked off with a roll under\\neach arm, and eating the other.\\n\\nThus I went up Market Street as far as Fourth Street, passing by the door\\nof Mr. Read, my future wife\\'s father: when she, standing at the door, saw\\nme, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous\\nappearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut Street and part of Walnut\\nStreet, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round, found myself again\\nat Market Street wharf, near the boat I came in, to which I went for a\\ndraught of the river water; and, being filled with one of my rolls, gave\\nthe other two to a woman and her child that came down the river in the\\nboat with us, and were waiting to go farther.\\n\\nThus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had many\\nclean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I joined\\nthem, and thereby was led into the great meetinghouse of the Quakers, near\\nthe market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round awhile and\\nhearing nothing said, being very drowsy through labor and want of rest the\\npreceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued so till the meeting\\nbroke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was, therefore, the\\nfirst house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.\\n\\nWalking down again toward the river, and looking in the faces of people, I\\nmet a young Quaker man, whose countenance I liked, and, accosting him,\\nrequested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging. We were\\nthen near the sign of the Three Mariners. \"Here,\" says he, \"is one place\\nthat entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt\\nwalk with me, I\\'ll show thee a better.\" He brought me to the Crooked\\nBillet, in Water Street. Here I got a dinner; and, while I was eating it,\\nseveral sly questions were asked me, as it seemed to be suspected from my\\nyouth and appearance that I might be some runaway. After dinner my\\nsleepiness returned, and, being shown to a bed, I lay down without\\nundressing, and slept till six in the evening; was called to supper, went\\nto bed again very early, and slept soundly till next morning.\\n\\n\\nNOTE.--The river referred to is the Delaware. Franklin was on his way from\\nBoston to Philadelphia, and had just walked from Amboy to Burlington, New\\nJersey, a distance of fifty miles.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXVII. LINES TO A WATERFOWL.

GOLDSMITH AND ADDISON. (435)\\n\\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray, 1811-1863, was born in Calcutta, and is one\\nof the most popular of English novelists, essayists, and humorists. While\\na boy, he removed from India to England, where he was educated at the\\nCharterhouse in London, and at Cambridge. When twenty-one years of age, he\\ncame into possession of about 20,000 pounds. He rapidly dissipated his\\nfortune, however, and was compelled to work for his living, first turning\\nhis attention to law and then to art, but finally choosing literature as\\nhis profession. He was for many years correspondent, under assumed names,\\nat the \"London Times,\" \"The New Monthly Magazine,\" \"Punch,\" and \"Fraser\\'s\\nMagazine.\" His first novel under his own name, \"Vanity Fair,\" appeared in\\nmonthly numbers during 1846-8, and is generally considered his finest\\nproduction: although \"Pendennis,\" \"Henry Esmond,\" and \"The Newcomes\" are\\nalso much admired. His lectures on \"English Humorists of the Eighteenth\\nCentury,\" from which the following selections are taken, were delivered in\\nEngland first in 1851, and afterwards in America, which he visited in 1852\\nand again in 1855-6. During the latter visit, he first delivered his\\ncourse of lectures on \"The Four Georges,\" which were later repeated in\\nEngland. At the close of 1859, Thackeray became editor of the \"Cornhill\\nMagazine,\" and made it one of the most successful serials ever published.\\n\\nThackeray has been charged with cynicism in his writings, but he was noted\\nfor his happy temper and genial disposition towards all who came in\\ncontact with him.\\n###\\n\\n\\n1. GOLDSMITH.\\n\\nTo be the most beloved of English writers, what a title that is for a man!\\nA wild youth, wayward, but full of tenderness and affection, quits the\\ncountry village where his boyhood has been passed in happy musing, in idle\\nshelter, in fond longing to see the great world out of doors, and achieve\\nname and fortune--and after years of dire struggle, and neglect, and\\npoverty, his heart turning back as fondly to his native place as it had\\nlonged eagerly for change when sheltered there, he writes a book and a\\npoem, full of the recollections and feelings of home; he paints the\\nfriends and scenes of his youth, and peoples Auburn and Wakefield with the\\nremembrances of Lissoy.\\n\\nWander he must, but he carries away a home relic with him, and dies with\\nit on his breast. His nature is truant; in repose it longs for change: as\\non the journey it looks back for friends and quiet. He passes to-day in\\nbuilding an air castle for to-morrow, or in writing yesterday\\'s elegy; and\\nhe would flyaway this hour, but that a cage, necessity, keeps him. What is\\nthe charm of his verse, of his style, and humor? His sweet regrets, his\\ndelicate compassion, his soft smile, his tremulous sympathy, the weakness\\nwhich he owns?\\n\\nYour love for him is half pity. You come hot and tired from the day\\'s\\nbattle, and this sweet minstrel sings to you. Who could harm the kind\\nvagrant harper? Whom did he ever hurt? He carries no weapon, save the harp\\non which he plays to you, and with which he delights great and humble,\\nyoung and old, the captains in the tents, or the soldiers round the fire,\\nor the women and children in the villages, at whose porches he stops and\\nsings his simple songs of love and beauty. With that sweet story of \"The\\nVicar of Wakefield\" he has found entry into every castle and every hamlet\\nin Europe. Not one of us, however busy or hard, but once or twice in our\\nlives has passed an evening with him, and undergone the charm of his\\ndelightful music.\\n\\n\\nII. ADDISON. (436)\\n\\nWe love him for his vanities as much as his virtues. What is ridiculous is\\ndelightful in him; we are so fond of him because we laugh at him so. And\\nout of that laughter, and out of that sweet weakness, and out of those\\nharmless eccentricities and follies, and out of that touched brain, and\\nout of that honest manhood and simplicity--we get a result of happiness,\\ngoodness, tenderness, pity, piety; such as doctors and divines but seldom\\nhave the fortune to inspire. And why not? Is the glory of Heaven to be\\nsung only by gentlemen in black coats?\\n\\nWhen this man looks from the world, whose weaknesses he describes so\\nbenevolently, up to the Heaven which shines over us all, I can hardly\\nfancy a human face lighted up with a more serene rapture; a human\\nintellect thrilling with a purer love and adoration than Joseph Addison\\'s.\\nListen to him: from your childhood you have known the verses; but who can\\nhear their sacred music without love and awe?\\n\\n  \"Soon as the evening shades prevail,\\n  The moon takes up the wondrous tale,\\n  And nightly to the listening earth\\n  Repeats the story of her birth;\\n  And all the stars that round her burn,\\n  And all the planets in their turn,\\n  Confirm the tidings as they roll,\\n  And spread the truth from pole to pole.\\n\\n  \"What though, in solemn silence, all\\n  Move round this dark terrestrial ball;\\n  What though no real voice nor sound\\n  Among their radiant orbs be found;\\n  In reason\\'s ear they all rejoice,\\n  And utter forth a glorious voice,\\n  Forever singing, as they shine,\\n  The Hand that made us is divine.\"\\n\\nIt seems to me those verses shine like the stars. They shine out of a\\ngreat, deep calm. When he turns to Heaven, a Sabbath comes over that man\\'s\\nmind; and his face lights up from it with a glory of thanks and prayers.\\nHis sense of religion stirs through his whole being. In the fields, in the\\ntown; looking at the birds in the trees; at the children in the streets;\\nin the morning or in the moonlight; over his books in his own room; in a\\nhappy party at a country merrymaking or a town assembly, good will and\\npeace to God\\'s creatures, and love and awe of Him who made them, fill his\\npure heart and shine from his kind face. If Swift\\'s life was the most\\nwretched, I think Addison\\'s was one of the most enviable. A life\\nprosperous and beautiful--a calm death--an immense fame and affection\\nafterwards for his happy and spotless name.\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--Goldsmith (see biographical notice, page 215) founded his\\ndescriptions of Auburn in the poem of \"The Deserted Village,\" and of\\nWakefield, in \"The Vicar of Wakefield,\" on recollections of his early home\\nat Lissoy.

(438)\\n\\nSCENE--CATO, alone, sitting in a thoughtful posture;--in his hand,\\n  Plato\\'s book on the immortality of the soul; a drawn sword on the\\n  table by him.\\n\\nCato. It must be so. Plato, thou reasonest well!\\n      Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,\\n      This longing after immortality?\\n      Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,\\n      Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul\\n      Back on herself, and startles at destruction?\\n      \\'T is the divinity that stirs within us;\\n      \\'T is heaven itself that points out an hereafter,\\n      And intimates eternity to man.\\n      Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!\\n      Through what variety of untried being,\\n      Through what new scenes and changes must we pass?\\n      The wide, unbounded prospect lies before me:\\n      But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.\\n      Here will I hold.

(440)\\n\\nJared Sparks, 1789-1866, was born at Willington, Connecticut, and\\ngraduated at Harvard in 1815. He was tutor in the University for two\\nyears, and in 1819 was ordained pastor of the Unitarian Church in\\nBaltimore. In 1823 he returned to Boston, purchased the \"North American\\nReview,\" and was its sole editor for seven years. From 1839 to 1849 he was\\nProfessor in Harvard, and for the next three years was President of the\\nUniversity. Mr. Sparks has written extensively on American history and\\nbiography, including the lives of Washington and Franklin. He collected\\nthe materials for his biographies with great care, and wrought them up\\nwith much skill.\\n###\\n\\n\\nThe person of Washington was commanding, graceful, and fitly proportioned;\\nhis stature six feet, his chest broad and full, his limbs long and\\nsomewhat slender, but well-shaped and muscular. His features were regular\\nand symmetrical, his eyes of a light blue color, and his whole\\ncountenance, in its quiet state, was grave, placid, and benignant. When\\nalone, or not engaged in conversation, he appeared sedate and thoughtful;\\nbut when his attention was excited, his eye kindled quickly, and his face\\nbeamed with animation and intelligence.\\n\\nHe was not fluent in speech, but what he said was apposite, and listened\\nto with the more interest as being known to come from the heart. He seldom\\nattempted sallies of wit or humor, but no man received more pleasure from\\nan exhibition of them by others; and, although contented in seclusion, he\\nsought his chief happiness in society, and participated with delight in\\nall its rational and innocent amusements. Without austerity on the one\\nhand, or an appearance of condescending familiarity on the other, he was\\naffable, courteous, and cheerful; but it has often been remarked that\\nthere was a dignity in his person and manner not easy to be defined, which\\nimpressed everyone that saw him for the first time with an instinctive\\ndeference and awe. This may have arisen, in part, from a conviction of his\\nsuperiority, as well as from the effect produced by his external form and\\ndeportment.\\n\\nThe character of his mind was unfolded in the public and private acts of\\nhis life; and the proofs of his greatness are seen almost as much in the\\none as the other. The same qualities which raised him to the ascendency he\\npossessed over the will of a nation, as the commander of armies and chief\\nmagistrate, caused him to be loved and respected as an individual. Wisdom,\\njudgment, prudence, and firmness were his predominant traits. No man ever\\nsaw more clearly the relative importance of things and actions, or\\ndivested himself more entirely of the bias of personal interest,\\npartiality, and prejudice, in discriminating between the true and the\\nfalse, the right and the wrong, in all questions and subjects that were\\npresented to him. He deliberated slowly, but decided surely; and when his\\ndecision was once formed he seldom reversed it, and never relaxed from the\\nexecution of a measure till it was completed. Courage, physical and moral,\\nwas a part of his nature; and, whether in battle, or in the midst of\\npopular excitement, he was fearless of danger, and regardless of\\nconsequences to himself.\\n\\nHis ambition was of that noble kind which aims to excel in whatever it\\nundertakes, and to acquire a power over the hearts of men by promoting\\ntheir happiness and winning their affections. Sensitive to the approbation\\nof others, and solicitous to deserve it, he made no concessions to gain\\ntheir applause, either by flattering their vanity or yielding to their\\ncaprices. Cautious without timidity, bold without rashness, cool in\\ncounsel, deliberate but firm in action, clear in foresight, patient under\\nreverses, steady, persevering, and self-possessed, he met and conquered\\nevery obstacle that obstructed his path to honor, renown and success. More\\nconfident in the uprightness of his intention than in his resources, he\\nsought knowledge and advice from other men. He chose his counselors with\\nunerring sagacity; and his quick perception of the soundness of an\\nopinion, and of the strong points in an argument, enabled him to draw to\\nhis aid the best fruits of their talents, and the light of their collected\\nwisdom.\\n\\nHis moral qualities were in perfect harmony with those of his intellect.\\nDuty was the ruling principle of his conduct; and the rare endowments of\\nhis understanding were not more constantly tasked to devise the best\\nmethods of effecting an object, than they were to guard the sanctity of\\nconscience. No instance can be adduced in which he was actuated by a\\nsinister motive or endeavored to attain an end by unworthy means. Truth,\\nintegrity, and justice were deeply rooted in his mind; and nothing could\\nrouse his indignation so soon, or so utterly destroy his confidence, as\\nthe discovery of the want of these virtues in anyone whom he had trusted.\\nWeaknesses, follies, indiscretions be could forgive; but subterfuge and\\ndishonesty he never forgot, rarely pardoned.\\n\\nHe was candid and sincere, true to his friends, and faithful to all;\\nneither practicing dissimulation, descending to artifice, nor holding out\\nexpectations which he did not intend should be realized. His passions were\\nstrong, and sometimes they broke out with vehemence: but he had the power\\nof checking them in an instant. Perhaps self-control was the most\\nremarkable trait of his character. It was, in part, the effect of\\ndiscipline; yet he seems by nature to have possessed this power in a\\ndegree which has been denied to other men.\\n\\nA Christian in faith and practice, he was habitually devout. His reverence\\nfor religion is seen in his example, his public communications, and his\\nprivate writings. He uniformly ascribed his successes to the beneficent\\nagency of the Supreme Being. Charitable and humane, he was liberal to the\\npoor, and kind to those in distress. As a husband, son, and brother, he\\nwas tender and affectionate. Without vanity, ostentation, or pride, he\\nnever spoke of himself or his actions unless required by circumstances\\nwhich concerned the public interests.\\n\\nAs he was free from envy, so he had the good fortune to escape the envy of\\nothers by standing on an elevation which none could hope to attain. If he\\nhad one passion more strong than another it was love of his country. The\\npurity and ardor of his patriotism were commensurate with the greatness of\\nits object. Love of country in him was invested with the sacred obligation\\nof a duty; and from the faithful discharge of this duty he never swerved\\nfor a moment, either in thought or deed, through the whole period of his\\neventful career.\\n\\nSuch are some of the traits in the character of Washington, which have\\nacquired for him the love and veneration of mankind. If they are not\\nmarked with the brilliancy, extravagance, and eccentricity, which, in\\nother men, have excited the astonishment of the world, so neither are they\\ntarnished by the follies, nor disgraced by the crimes of those men. It is\\nthe happy combination of rare talents and qualities, the harmonious union\\nof the intellectual and moral powers, rather than the dazzling splendor of\\nany one trait, which constitute the grandeur of his character. If the\\ntitle of great man ought to be reserved for him who can not be charged\\nwith an indiscretion or a vice; who spent his life in establishing the\\nindependence, the glory, and durable prosperity of his country; who\\nsucceeded in all that he undertook; and whose successes were never won at\\nthe expense of honor, justice, integrity, or by the sacrifice of a single\\nprinciple,--this title will not be denied to Washington.\\n\\n\\n\\n      How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!\\n      While the mere victors may appall or stun\\n      The servile and the vain, such names will be\\n      A watchword till the future shall be free.\\n                                                --Byron.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXI. EULOGY ON WASHINGTON. (444)\\n\\nGeneral Henry Lee, 1756-1818, a member of the celebrated Lee family of\\nVirginia, was born in Westmoreland County in that state, and died on\\nCumberland Island, Georgia. He graduated at Princeton in his eighteenth\\nyear. In 1777 he marched with a regiment of cavalry to join the patriot\\narmy, and served with fidelity and success till the close of the war. He\\nwas noted for his bravery, skill, and celerity, and received the nickname\\nof \"Light-horse Harry.\" He was a great favorite with both General Greene\\nand General Washington. In 1786 Virginia appointed him one of her\\ndelegates to Congress; he also took an active part in favor of the\\nadoption of the constitution in the Virginia Convention of 1788. On the\\nbreaking out of the \"Whisky Rebellion\" in Pennsylvania, in 1794, the\\nPresident sent General Lee with an army to suppress the disturbance. The\\ninsurgents submitted without resistance. In 1799 he was again a member of\\nCongress; and, on the death of Washington, that body appointed him to\\npronounce a eulogy upon the life and character of the great and good man.\\nThe following extract contains the closing part of the oration.\\n###\\n\\n\\nWho is there that has forgotten the vales of Brandywine, the fields of\\nGermantown, or the plains of Monmouth? Everywhere present, wants of every\\nkind obstructing, numerous and valiant armies encountering, himself a\\nhost, he assuaged our sufferings, limited our privations, and upheld our\\ntottering Republic. Shall I display to you the spread of the fire of his\\nsoul by rehearsing the praises of the hero of Saratoga, and his much-loved\\ncompeer of the Carolinas? No; our Washington wears not borrowed glory. To\\nGates--to Greene, he gave without reserve the applause due to their\\neminent merit; and long may the chiefs of Saratoga and of Eutaw receive\\nthe grateful respect of a grateful people.\\n\\nMoving in his own orbit, he imparted heat and light to his most distant\\nsatellites; and, combining the physical and moral force of all within his\\nsphere, with irresistible weight he took his course, commiserating folly,\\ndisdaining vice, dismaying treason, and invigorating despondency; until\\nthe auspicious hour arrived, when, united with the intrepid forces of a\\npotent and magnanimous ally, he brought to submission Cornwallis, since\\nthe conqueror of India; thus finishing his long career of military glory\\nwith a luster corresponding to his great name, and in this his last act of\\nwar, affixing the seal of fate to our nation\\'s birth.\\n\\nFirst in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,\\nhe was second to none in humble and endearing scenes of private life.\\nPious, just, humane, temperate, sincere, uniform, dignified, and\\ncommanding, his example was edifying to all around him, as were the\\neffects of that example lasting.\\n\\nTo his equals, he was condescending; to his inferiors, kind; and to the\\ndear object of his affections, exemplarily tender. Correct throughout,\\nvice shuddered in his presence, and virtue always felt his fostering hand;\\nthe purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.\\n\\nHis last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life. Although in\\nextreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan, escaped him; and with undisturbed\\nserenity he closed his well-spent life. Such was the man America has lost!\\nSuch was the man for whom our nation mourns!\\n\\n\\nNOTES.--At Brandywine Creek, in Pennsylvania, 18,000 British, under Howe,\\ndefeated 13,000 Americans under Washington.\\n\\nGermantown, near Philadelphia, was the scene of an American defeat by the\\nBritish, the same generals commanding as at Brandywine.\\n\\nThe battle of Monmouth, in New Jersey, resulted in victory for the\\nAmericans.\\n\\nThe hero of Saratoga was General Gates, who there compelled the surrender\\nof General Burgoyne.\\n\\nAt Eutaw Springs, General Greene defeated a superior force of British.\\n\\nCornwallis, Charles, second earl and first marquis (b. 1738, d. 1805),\\nsurrendered his forces to a combined American and French army and French\\nfleet at Yorktown, in 1781, virtually ending the war.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXII. THE SOLITARY REAPER. (446)\\n\\nWilliam Wordsworth, 1770-1850, the founder of the \"Lake School\" of poets,\\nwas born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, England. From his boyhood he was a\\ngreat lover and student of nature, and it is to his beautiful descriptions\\nof landscape, largely, that he owes his fame. He was a graduate of\\nCambridge University, and while there commenced the study of Chaucer,\\nSpenser, Milton, and Shakespeare, as models for his own writings. Two\\nlegacies having been bequeathed him, Wordsworth determined to make poetry\\nthe aim of his life, and in 1795 located at Racedown with his sister\\nDorothy, where he commenced the tragedy of \"The Borderers.\" A visit from\\nColeridge at this period made the two poets friends for life. In 1802\\nWordsworth married Miss Mary Hutchinson, and in 1813 he settled at Rydal\\nMount, on Lake Windermere, where he passed the remainder of his life.\\n\\nWordsworth\\'s poetry is remarkable for its extreme simplicity of language.\\nAt first his efforts were almost universally ridiculed, and in 1819 his\\nentire income from literary work had not amounted to 140 Pounds. In 1830\\nhis merit began to be recognized; in 1839 Oxford University conferred upon\\nhim the degree of D. C. L.; and in 1843 he was made poet laureate.\\n\\n\"The Excursion\" is by far the most beautiful and the most important of\\nWordsworth\\'s productions. \"Salisbury Plain,\" \"The White Doe of Rylstone,\"\\n\"Yarrow Revisited,\" and many of his sonnets and minor poems are also much\\nadmired.\\n###\\n\\n\\nBehold her, single in the field,\\nYon solitary Highland lass!\\nReaping and singing by herself;\\nStop here, or gently pass!\\nAlone she cuts and binds the grain,\\nAnd sings a melancholy strain;\\nOh listen! for the vale profound\\nIs overflowing with the sound.\\n\\nNo nightingale did ever chant\\nMore welcome notes to weary bands\\nOf travelers in some shady haunt,\\nAmong Arabian sands:\\nA voice so thrilling ne\\'er was heard\\nIn springtime from the cuckoo bird,\\nBreaking the silence of the seas\\nAmong the farthest Hebrides.\\n\\nWill no one tell me what she sings?\\nPerhaps the plaintive numbers flow\\nFor old, unhappy, far-off things,\\nAnd battles long ago:\\nOr is it some more humble lay,\\nFamiliar matter of to-day?\\nSome natural sorrow, loss, or pain,\\nThat has been, and may be again?\\n\\nWhate\\'er the theme, the maiden sang\\nAs if her song could have no ending;\\nI saw her singing at her work,\\nAnd o\\'er the sickle bending;--\\nI listened motionless and still;\\nAnd, as I mounted up the hill,\\nThe music in my heart I bore,\\nLong after it was heard no more.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXIII. VALUE OF THE PRESENT. (447)\\n\\nRalph Waldo Emerson, 1803-1882, the celebrated essayist and philosopher,\\nwas born in Boston. His father was a Unitarian minister, and the son,\\nafter graduating at Harvard University, entered the ministry also, and\\ntook charge of a Unitarian congregation in Boston. His peculiar ideas on\\nreligious topics soon caused him to retire from the ministry, and he then\\ndevoted himself to literature. As a lecturer, Emerson attained a wide\\nreputation, both in this country and in England, and he is considered as\\none of the most independent and original thinkers of the age. His style is\\nbrief and pithy, dazzling by its wit, but sometimes paradoxical. He wrote\\na few poems, but they are not generally admired, being didactic in style,\\nbare, and obscure. Among his best known publications are his volume\\n\"Nature,\" and his lectures, \"The Mind and Manners of the Nineteenth\\nCentury,\" \"The Superlative in Manners and Literature,\" \"English Character\\nand Manners,\" and \"The Conduct of Life.\" In 1850 appeared \"Representative\\nMen,\" embracing sketches of Plato, Swedenborg, Montaigne, Shakespeare,\\nNapoleon, and Goethe.\\n\\n\\nSuch are the days,--the earth is the cup, the sky is the cover, of the\\nimmense bounty of nature which is offered us for our daily aliment; but\\nwhat a force of illusion begins life with us, and attends us to the end!\\nWe are coaxed, flattered, and duped, from morn to eve, from birth to\\ndeath; and where is the old eye that ever saw through the deception? The\\nHindoos represent Maia, the illusory energy of Vishnu, as one of his\\nprincipal attributes. As if, in this gale of warring elements, which life\\nis, it was necessary to bind souls to human life as mariners in a tempest\\nlash themselves to the mast and bulwarks of a ship, and Nature employed\\ncertain illusions as her ties and straps,--a rattle, a doll, an apple, for\\na child; skates, a river, a boat, a horse, a gun, for the growing\\nboy;--and I will not begin to name those of the youth and adult, for they\\nare numberless. Seldom and slowly the mask falls, and the pupil is\\npermitted to see that all is one stuff, cooked and painted under many\\ncounterfeit appearances. Hume\\'s doctrine was that the circumstances vary,\\nthe amount of happiness does not; that the beggar cracking fleas in the\\nsunshine under a hedge, and the duke rolling by in his chariot, the girl\\nequipped for her first ball, and the orator returning triumphant from the\\ndebate, had different means, but the same quantity of pleasant excitement.\\n\\nThis element of illusion lends all its force to hide the values of present\\ntime. Who is he that does not always find himself doing something less\\nthan his best task? \"What are you doing?\" \"Oh, nothing; I have been doing\\nthus, or I shall do so or so, but now I am only--\" Ah! poor dupe, will you\\nnever slip out of the web of the master juggler?--never learn that, as\\nsoon as the irrecoverable years have woven their blue glory between to-day\\nand us, these passing hours shall glitter and draw us, as the wildest\\nromance and the homes of beauty and poetry? How difficult to deal erect\\nwith them! The events they bring, their trade, entertainments, and gossip,\\ntheir urgent work, all throw dust in the eyes and distract attention. He\\nis a strong man who can look them in the eye, see through this juggle,\\nfeel their identity, and keep his own; who can know surely that one will\\nbe like another to the end of the world, nor permit love, or death, or\\npolitics, or money, war, or pleasure, to draw him from his task.\\n\\nThe world is always equal to itself, and every man in moments of deeper\\nthought is apprised that he is repeating the experiences of the people in\\nthe streets of Thebes or Byzantium. An everlasting Now reigns in nature,\\nwhich hangs the same roses on our bushes which charmed the Roman and the\\nChaldean in their hanging gardens. \"To what end, then,\" he asks, \"should I\\nstudy languages, and traverse countries, to learn so simple truths?\"\\n\\nHistory of ancient art, excavated cities, recovery of books and\\ninscriptions,--yes, the works were beautiful, and the history worth\\nknowing; and academies convene to settle the claims of the old schools.\\nWhat journeys and measurements,--Niebuhr and Muller and Layard,--to\\nidentify the plain of Troy and Nimroud town! And your homage to Dante\\ncosts you so much sailing; and to ascertain the discoverers of America\\nneeds as much voyaging as the discovery cost. Poor child! that flexible\\nclay of which these old brothers molded their admirable symbols was not\\nPersian, nor Memphian, nor Teutonic, nor local at all, but was common lime\\nand silex and water, and sunlight, the heat of the blood, and the heaving\\nof the lungs; it was that clay which thou heldest but now in thy foolish\\nhands, and threwest away to go and seek in vain in sepulchers, mummy pits,\\nand old bookshops of Asia Minor, Egypt, and England. It was the deep\\nto-day which all men scorn; the rich poverty, which men hate; the\\npopulous, all-loving solitude, which men quit for the tattle of towns. He\\nlurks, he hides,--he who is success, reality, joy, and power. One of the\\nillusions is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour.\\nWrite it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. No man\\nhas learned anything rightly, until he knows that every day is Doomsday.\\n\\'T is the old secret of the gods that they come in low disguises. \\'T is\\nthe vulgar great who come dizened with gold and jewels. Real kings hide\\naway their crowns in their wardrobes, and affect a plain and poor\\nexterior. In the Norse legend of our ancestors, Odin dwells in a fisher\\'s\\nhut, and patches a boat. In the Hindoo legends, Hari dwells a peasant\\namong peasants. In the Greek legend, Apollo lodges with the shepherds of\\nAdmetus; and Jove liked to rusticate among the poor Ethiopians. So, in our\\nhistory, Jesus is born in a barn, and his twelve peers are fishermen. \\'T\\nis the very principle of science that Nature shows herself best in leasts;\\n\\'t was the maxim of Aristotle and Lucretius; and, in modern times, of\\nSwedenborg and of Hahnemann. The order of changes in the egg determines\\nthe age of fossil strata. So it was the rule of our poets, in the legends\\nof fairy lore, that the fairies largest in power were the least in size.\\n\\nIn the Christian graces, humility stands highest of all, in the form of\\nthe Madonna; and in life, this is the secret of the wise. We owe to genius\\nalways the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common, and showing\\nus that divinities are sitting disguised in the seeming gang of gypsies\\nand peddlers. In daily life, what distinguishes the master is the using\\nthose materials he has, instead of looking about for what are more\\nrenowned, or what others have used well. \"A general,\" said Bonaparte,\\n\"always has troops enough, if he only knows how to employ those he has,\\nand bivouacs with them.\" Do not refuse the employment which the hour\\nbrings you, for one more ambitious. The highest heaven of wisdom is alike\\nnear from every point, and thou must find it, if at all, by methods native\\nto thyself alone.\\n\\nNOTES.--The Brahmanic religion teaches a Trinity, of which Vishnu is the\\nsavior of mankind.\\n\\nThebes, the ancient capital of Upper Egypt, was at its most flourishing\\nperiod about 1500 B. C. Byzantium was an important Greek city during the\\nsecond and third centuries B.

The first two were Germans,\\nand the last an Englishman.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXIV. HAPPINESS. (451)\\n\\nAlexander Pope, 1688-1744, was the shining literary light of the so-called\\nAugustan reign of Queen Anne, the poetry of which was distinguished by the\\nhighest degree of polish and elegance. Pope was the son of a retired linen\\ndraper, who lived in a pleasant country house near the Windsor Forest. He\\nwas so badly deformed that his life was \"one long disease;\" he was\\nremarkably precocious, and had a most intelligent face, with great,\\nflaming, tender eyes. In disposition Pope was the reverse of admirable. He\\nwas extremely sensitive, petulant, and supercilious; fierce and even\\ncoarse in his attacks on opponents; boastful of his self-acquired wealth\\nand of his intimacy with the nobility. The great redeeming feature of his\\ncharacter was his tender devotion to his aged parents.\\n\\nAs a poet, however, Pope challenges the highest admiration. At the age of\\nsixteen he commenced his \"Pastorals,\" and when only twenty-one published\\nhis \"Essay on Criticism,\" pronounced \"the finest piece of argumentative\\nand reasoning poetry in the English language.\" His reputation was now\\nfirmly established, and his literary activity ceased only at his death;\\nalthough, during the latter portion of his life, he was so weak physically\\nthat he was unable to dress himself or even to rise from bed without\\nassistance. Pope\\'s great admiration was Dryden, whose style he studied and\\ncopied. He lacks the latter\\'s strength, but in elegance and polish he\\nremains unequaled.\\n\\nPope\\'s most remarkable work is \"The Rape of the Lock;\" his greatest, the\\ntranslation into English verse of Homer\\'s \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey.\" His\\n\"Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard,\" \"The Dunciad,\" and the \"Essay On Man\" are\\nalso famous productions. He published an edition of \"Shakespeare,\" which\\nwas awaited with great curiosity, and received with equal disappointment.\\nDuring the three years following its appearance, he united with Swift and\\nArbuthnot in writing the \"Miscellanies,\" an extensive satire on the abuses\\nof learning and the extravagances of philosophy. His \"Epistles,\" addressed\\nto various distinguished men, and covering a period of four years, were\\ncopied after those of Horace; they were marked by great clearness,\\nneatness of diction, and good sense, and by Pope\\'s usual elegance and\\ngrace. His \"Imitations of Horace\" was left unfinished at his death.\\n\\nThe following selection is an extract from the \"Essay on Man;\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nOh, sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,\\nBy mountains piled on mountains, to the skies?\\nHeaven still with laughter the vain toil surveys,\\nAnd buries madmen in the heaps they raise.\\nKnow all the good that individuals find,\\nOr God and nature meant to mere mankind.\\nReason\\'s whole pleasure, all the joys of sense,\\nLie in three words,--health, peace, and competence.\\n\\nBut health consists with temperance alone;\\nAnd peace, O virtue! peace is all thy own.\\nThe good or bad the gifts of fortune gain;\\nBut these less taste them as they worse obtain.\\nSay, in pursuit of profit or delight,\\nWho risk the most, that take wrong means or right?\\nOf vice or virtue, whether blest or curst,\\nWhich meets contempt, or which compassion first?\\n\\nCount all th\\' advantage prosperous vice attains,\\n\\'T is but what virtue flies from and disdains:\\nAnd grant the bad what happiness they would,\\nOne they must want, which is, to pass for good.\\nOh, blind to truth, and God\\'s whole scheme below,\\nWho fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe!\\nWho sees and follows that great scheme the best,\\nBest knows the blessing, and will most be blest.\\n\\nBut fools the good alone unhappy call,\\nFor ills or accidents that chance to all.\\nThink we, like some weak prince, the Eternal Cause,\\nProne for his favorites to reverse his laws?\\nShall burning AEtna, if a sage requires,\\nForget to thunder, and recall her fires?\\nWhen the loose mountain trembles from on high,\\nShall gravitation cease, if you go by?\\n\\n\"But sometimes virtue starves while vice is fed.\"\\nWhat, then?

MARION. (453)\\n\\nWilliam Gilmore Simms, 1806-1870, one of the most versatile, prolific, and\\npopular of American authors, was born at Charleston, South Carolina. His\\nfamily was poor, and his means of education were limited, yet he managed\\nto prepare himself for the bar, to which he was admitted when twenty-one\\nyears of age. The law proving uncongenial, he abandoned it, and in 1828\\nbecame editor of the \"Charleston City Gazette.\" From this time till his\\ndeath his literary activity was unceasing, and his writings were so\\nnumerous that it is possible only to group them under their various heads.\\nThey comprise Biography; History; Historical Romance, both Foreign and\\nDomestic, the latter being further divided into Colonial, Revolutionary,\\nand Border Romances; Pure Romance; The Drama; Poetry; and Criticism;\\nbesides miscellaneous books and pamphlets.\\n\\nIn the midst of this remarkable literary activity, Mr. Simms still found\\ntime to devote to the affairs of state, being for several years a member\\nof the South Carolina Legislature. He was also a lecturer, and was\\nconnected editorially with several magazines. Most of his time was spent\\nat his summer house in Charleston, and at his winter residence,\\n\"Woodlands,\" on a plantation at Midway, S. C.\\n\\nThe following selection is from \"The Life and Times of Francis Marion.\"\\n###\\n\\n\\nArt had done little to increase the comforts or the securities of his\\nfortress. It was one, complete to his hands, from those of nature--such an\\none as must have delighted the generous English outlaw of Sherwood Forest;\\ninsulated by deep ravines and rivers, a dense forest of mighty trees, and\\ninterminable undergrowth. The vine and brier guarded his passes. The\\nlaurel and the shrub, the vine and sweet-scented jessamine roofed his\\ndwelling, and clambered up between his closed eyelids and the stars.\\nObstructions scarcely penetrable by any foe, crowded the pathways to his\\ntent; and no footstep not practiced in the secret, and to \"the manner\\nborn,\" might pass unchallenged to his midnight rest. The swamp was his\\nmoat; his bulwarks were the deep ravines, which, watched by sleepless\\nrifles, were quite as impregnable as the castles on the Rhine. Here, in\\nthe possession of his fortress, the partisan slept secure.\\n\\nHis movements were marked by equal promptitude and wariness. He suffered\\nno risks from a neglect of proper precaution. His habits of circumspection\\nand resolve ran together in happy unison. His plans, carefully considered\\nbeforehand, were always timed with the happiest reference to the condition\\nand feelings of his men. To prepare that condition, and to train those\\nfeelings, were the chief employment of his repose. He knew his game, and\\nhow it should be played, before a step was taken or a weapon drawn.\\n\\nWhen he himself or any of his parties left the island upon an expedition,\\nthey advanced along no beaten paths. They made them as they went. He had\\nthe Indian faculty in perfection, of gathering his course from the sun,\\nfrom the stars, from the bark and the tops of trees, and such other\\nnatural guides as the woodman acquires only through long and watchful\\nexperience.\\n\\nMany of the trails thus opened by him, upon these expeditions, are now the\\nordinary avenues of the country. On starting, he almost invariably struck\\ninto the woods, and seeking the heads of the larger water courses, crossed\\nthem at their first and small beginnings. He destroyed the bridges where\\nhe could. He preferred fords. The former not only facilitated the progress\\nof less fearless enemies, but apprised them of his own approach. If speed\\nwas essential, a more direct but not less cautious route was pursued.\\n\\nHe intrusted his schemes to nobody, not even his most confidential\\nofficers. He consulted with them respectfully, heard them patiently,\\nweighed their suggestions, and silently approached his conclusions. They\\nknew his determinations only from his actions. He left no track behind\\nhim, if it were possible to avoid it. He was often vainly hunted after by\\nhis own detachments. He was more apt at finding them than they him. His\\nscouts were taught a peculiar and shrill whistle, which, at night, could\\nbe heard at a most astonishing distance. We are reminded of a signal of\\nRoderick Dhu:--\\n\\n                  \"He whistled shrill,\\n    And he was answered from the hill;\\n    Wild as the scream of the curlew,\\n    From crag to crag the signal flew.\"\\n\\nHis expeditions were frequently long, and his men, hurrying forth without\\ndue preparation, not unfrequently suffered much privation from want of\\nfood. To guard against this danger, it was their habit to watch his cook.\\nIf they saw him unusually busied in preparing supplies of the rude,\\nportable food which it was Marion\\'s custom to carry on such occasions,\\nthey knew what was before them, and provided themselves accordingly. In no\\nother way could they arrive at their general\\'s intentions. His favorite\\ntime for moving was with the setting sun, and then it was known that the\\nmarch would continue all night.\\n\\nHis men were badly clothed in homespun,--a light wear which afforded\\nlittle warmth. They slept in the open air, and frequently without a\\nblanket. Their ordinary food consisted of sweet potatoes, garnished, on\\nfortunate occasions, with lean beef. Their swords, unless taken from the\\nenemy, were made out of mill saws, roughly manufactured by a forest\\nblacksmith.\\n\\nHis scouts were out in all directions, and at all hours. They did the\\ndouble duty of patrol and spies. They hovered about the posts of the\\nenemy, crouching in the thicket, or darting along the plain, picking up\\nprisoners, and information, and spoils together. They cut off stragglers,\\nencountered patrols of the foe, and arrested his supplies on the way to\\nthe garrison. Sometimes the single scout, buried in the thick tops of the\\ntree, looked down upon the march of his legions, or hung, perched over the\\nhostile encampment, till it slept; then slipping down, stole through the\\nsilent host, carrying off a drowsy sentinel, or a favorite charger, upon\\nwhich the daring spy flourished conspicuous among his less fortunate\\ncompanions.\\n\\nNOTES.--The outlaw of Sherwood Forest was Robin Hood.\\n\\nRoderick Dhu is a character in Sir Walter Scott\\'s poem, \"The Lady of the\\nLake,\" from which the quotation is taken.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXVI. A COMMON THOUGHT. (456)\\n\\nHenry Timrod, 1829-1867, was born at Charleston, South Carolina. He\\ninherited his father\\'s literary taste and ability, and had the advantages\\nof a liberal education. He entered the University of Georgia before he was\\nseventeen years of age, and while there commenced his career as a poet.\\nPoverty and ill health compelled him to leave the university without\\ntaking a degree; he then commenced the study of law, and for ten years\\ntaught in various private families. At the outbreak of the war, in 1860,\\nhe warmly espoused the Southern cause, and wrote many stirring war lyrics.\\nIn 1863 he joined the Army of the West, as correspondent of the Charleston\\n\"Mercury,\" and in 1864 he became editor of the \"South Carolinian,\"\\npublished first at Columbia and later at Charleston. He also served for a\\ntime as assistant secretary to Governor Orr. The advance of Sherman\\'s army\\nreduced him to poverty, and he was compelled to the greatest drudgery in\\norder to earn a bare living. His health soon broke down, and he died of\\nhemorrhage of the lungs. The following little poem seems, almost, to have\\nbeen written under a presentiment, so accurately does it describe the\\nclosing incidents of the poet\\'s life.\\n\\nThe first volume of Timrod\\'s poems appeared in 1860. A later edition, with\\na memoir of the author, was published in New York in 1873.\\n###\\n\\n\\nSomewhere on this earthly planet\\n  In the dust of flowers that be,\\nIn the dewdrop, in the sunshine,\\n  Sleeps a solemn day for me.\\n\\nAt this wakeful hour of midnight\\n  I behold it dawn in mist,\\nAnd I hear a sound of sobbing\\n  Through the darkness,--Hist! oh, hist!\\n\\nIn a dim and musky chamber,\\n  I am breathing life away;\\nSome one draws a curtain softly,\\n  And I watch the broadening day.\\n\\nAs it purples in the zenith,\\n  As it brightens on the lawn,\\nThere\\'s a hush of death about me,\\n  And a whisper, \"He is gone!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXVII. A DEFINITE AIM IN READING. (457)\\n\\nNoah Porter, 1811-1892, was born at Farmington, Conn., and graduated at\\nYale in 1831. He remained in New Haven as a school-teacher, a tutor in\\ncollege, and a student in the theological department until 1836, when he\\nentered the ministry. In 1846 he was recalled to the college as Clark\\nProfessor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics; and in 1858 he also assumed\\nthe duties of the professorship of Systematic Theology, for a period of\\nseven years. Upon the retirement of President Woolsey in 1871, he was\\nelected to fill the office, which he held until 1886, being the eleventh\\npresident of the college.\\n\\nPresident Porter\\'s greatest literary work is entitled, \"The Human\\nIntellect: With an Introduction upon Psychology and the Human Soul.\" It is\\nremarkable for the clear thought and sound judgment it displays, as well\\nas for its broad scholarship; and it has been pronounced \"the most\\ncomplete and exhaustive exhibition of the cognitive faculties of the human\\nsoul to be found in our language.\" His other important works are: \"The\\nSciences of Nature versus the Science of Man,\" which is a review of the\\ndoctrines of Herbert Spencer; \"American Colleges and the American Public;\"\\nand the book from which the following selection is taken, namely, \"Books\\nand Reading.\" Besides these he wrote numerous essays, contributions to\\nperiodicals, etc. During his professorship he was called upon to act as\\nchief editor in the important work of revising \"Webster\\'s Dictionary.\" The\\nedition of 1864 was the result of his careful oversight, and the\\nsubsequent revisions were also under his superintendence.\\n##\\n\\n\\nIn reading, we do well to propose to ourselves definite ends and purposes.\\nThe more distinctly we are aware of our own wants and desires in reading,\\nthe more definite and permanent will be our acquisitions. Hence it is a\\ngood rule to ask ourselves frequently, \"Why am I reading this book, essay,\\nor poem? or why am I reading it at the present time rather than any\\nother?\" It may often be a satisfying answer, that it is convenient; that\\nthe book happens to be at hand: or that we read to pass away the time.\\nSuch reasons are often very good, but they ought not always to satisfy us.\\nYet the very habit of proposing these questions, however they may be\\nanswered, will involve the calling of ourselves to account for our\\nreading, and the consideration of it in the light of wisdom and duty.\\n\\nThe distinct consciousness of some object at present before us, imparts a\\nmanifoldly greater interest to the contents of any volume. It imparts to\\nthe reader an appropriate power, a force of affinity, by which he\\ninsensibly and unconsciously attracts to himself all that has a near or\\neven a remote relation to the end for which he reads. Anyone is conscious\\nof this who reads a story with the purpose of repeating it to an absent\\nfriend; or an essay or a report with the design of using its facts or\\narguments in a debate; or a poem with the design of reviving its imagery,\\nand reciting its finest passages. Indeed, one never learns to read\\neffectively until he learns to read in such a spirit--not always, indeed,\\nfor a definite end, yet always with a mind attent to appropriate and\\nretain and turn to the uses of culture, if not to a more direct\\napplication.\\n\\nThe private history of every self-educated man, from Franklin onwards,\\nattests that they all were uniformly not only earnest but select in their\\nreading, and that they selected their books with distinct reference to the\\npurposes for which they used them. Indeed, the reason why self-trained\\nmen so often surpass men who are trained by others in the effectiveness\\nand success of their reading, is that they know for what they read and\\nstudy, and have definite aims and wishes in all their dealings with books.\\nThe omnivorous and indiscriminate reader, who is at the same time a\\nlistless and passive reader, however ardent is his curiosity, can never be\\na reader of the most effective sort.\\n\\nAnother good rule is suggested by the foregoing. Always have some solid\\nreading in hand; i. e., some work or author which we carry forward from\\none day to another, or one hour of leisure to the next, with persistence,\\ntill we have finished whatever we have undertaken. There are many great\\nand successful readers who do not observe this rule, but it is a good rule\\nnotwithstanding.\\n\\nThe writer once called upon one of the most extensive and persevering of\\nmodern travelers, at an early hour of the day, to attend him upon a walk\\nto a distant village. It was after breakfast, and though he had but few\\nminutes at command, he was sitting with book in hand--a book of solid\\nhistory he was perusing day after day. He remarked: \"This has been my\\nhabit for years in all my wanderings. It is the one habit which gives\\nsolidity to my intellectual activities and imparts tone to my life. It is\\nonly in this way that I can overcome and counteract the tendency to the\\ndissipation of my powers and the distraction of my attention, as strange\\npersons and strange scenes present themselves from day to day.\"\\n\\nTo the rule already given--read with a definite aim--we could add the\\nrule--make your aims to be definite by continuously holding them rigidly\\nto a single book at all times, except when relaxation requires you to\\ncease to work, and to live for amusement and play. Always have at least\\none iron in the fire, and kindle the fire at least once every day.\\n\\nIt is implied in the preceding that we should read upon definite subjects,\\nand with a certain method and proportion in the choice of our books. If we\\nhave a single object to accomplish in our reading for the present, that\\nobject will of necessity direct the choice of what we read, and we shall\\narrange our reading with reference to this single end. This will be a\\nnucleus around which our reading will for the moment naturally gather and\\narrange itself.\\n\\nIf several subjects seem to us equally important and interesting, we\\nshould dispose of them in order, and give to each for the time our chief\\nand perhaps our exclusive attention. That this is wise is so obvious as\\nnot to require illustration. \"One thing at a time,\" is an accepted\\ncondition for all efficient activity, whether it is employed upon things\\nor thoughts, upon men or books. If five or ten separate topics have equal\\nclaim upon our interest and attention, we shall do to each the amplest\\njustice, if we make each in its turn the central subject of our reading.\\nThere is little danger of weariness or monotony from the workings of such\\na rule.\\n\\nMost single topics admit or require a considerable variety of books, each\\ndifferent from the other, and each supplementing the other. Hence it is\\none of the best of practices in prosecuting a course of reading, to read\\nevery author who can cast any light upon the subject which we have in\\nhand. For example, if we are reading the history of the Great Rebellion in\\nEngland, we should read, if we can, not a single author only, as\\nClarendon, but a half dozen or a half score, each of whom writes from his\\nown point of view, supplies what another omits, or corrects what he under-\\nor overstates.\\n\\nBut, besides the formal histories of the period, there are the various\\nnovels, the scenes and characters of which are placed in those times, such\\nas Scott\\'s Woodstock; there are also diaries, such as those by Evelyn,\\nPepys, and Burton; and there are memoirs, such as those of Col.\\nHutchinson; while the last two have been imitated in scores of fictions.\\nThere are poems, such as those of Andrew Marvell, Milton, and Dryden.\\nThere are also shoals of political tracts and pamphlets, of handbills and\\ncaricatures.\\n\\nWe name these various descriptions of works and classes of reading, not\\nbecause we suppose all of them are accessible to those readers who live at\\na distance from large public libraries, or because we would advise\\neveryone who may have access to such libraries, to read all these books\\nand classes of books as a matter of course, but because we would\\nillustrate how great is the variety of books and reading matter that are\\ngrouped around a single topic, and are embraced within a single period.\\n\\nEvery person must judge for himself how long a time he can bestow upon any\\nsingle subject, or how many and various are the books in respect to it\\nwhich it is wise to read; but of this everyone may be assured, that it is\\nfar easier, far more agreeable, and far more economical of time and\\nenergy, to concentrate the attention upon a single subject at a time than\\nto extend it to half a score, and that six books read in succession or\\ntogether upon a single topic, are far more interesting and profitable than\\ntwice as many which treat of topics remotely related. A lady well known to\\nthe writer, of the least possible scholarly pretensions or literary\\nnotoriety, spent fifteen months of leisure, snatched by fragments from\\nonerous family cares and brilliant social engagements, in reading the\\nhistory of Greece as written by a great variety of authors and as\\nillustrated by many accessories of literature and art.\\n\\nNor should it be argued that such rules as these, or the habits which they\\nenjoin, are suitable for scholars only, or for people who have much\\nleisure for reading. It should rather be urged that those who can read the\\nfewest books and who have at command the scantiest time, should aim to\\nread with the greatest concentration and method; should occupy all of\\ntheir divided energy with single centers of interest, and husband the few\\nhours which they can command, in reading whatever converges to a definite,\\nbecause to a single, impression.\\n\\n\\n\\nCXXXVIII. ODE TO MT. BLANC. (462)\\n\\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, 1772-1834, was born in Devonshire, England, and\\nwas educated at Christ\\'s Hospital and Cambridge University. Through\\npoverty he was compelled to enlist in the army, but his literary\\nattainments soon brought him into notice, and he was enabled to withdraw\\nfrom the distasteful life.\\n\\nColeridge\\'s fame arises chiefly from his poems, of which the \"Rime of the\\nAncient Mariner,\" \"Genevieve,\" and \"Christabel\" may be classed among the\\nbest of English poetry. He also wrote a number of dramas, besides numerous\\nessays on religious and political topics. As a conversationalist Coleridge\\nhad a remarkable reputation, and among his ardent admirers and friends may\\nbe ranked Southey, Wordsworth, Lovell, Lamb, and De Quincey. He and his\\nfriends Southey and Lovell married sisters, and talked at one time of\\nfounding a community on the banks of the Susquehanna. Although possessing\\nsuch brilliant natural gifts, Coleridge fell far short of what he might\\nhave attained, through a great lack of energy and application, increased\\nby an excessive use of opium.\\n###\\n\\n\\nHast thou a charm to stay the morning star\\nIn his steep course? So long he seems to pause\\nOn thy bald, awful head, O sovran Blanc!\\nThe Arve and Arveiron at thy base\\nRave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form,\\nRisest from forth thy silent sea of pines,\\nHow silently! Around thee and above,\\nDeep is the air and dark, substantial, black--\\nAn ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,\\nAs with a wedge!

I gazed upon thee\\nTill thou, still present to the bodily sense,\\nDidst vanish from my thoughts: entranced in prayer,\\nI worshiped the Invisible alone.\\n\\n  Yet, like some sweet, beguiling melody,\\nSo sweet we know not we are listening to it,\\nThou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought--\\nYea, with my life and life\\'s own secret joy\\nTill the dilating soul, enrapt, transfused,\\nInto the mighty vision passing--there,\\nAs in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!\\n\\n  Awake, my soul! not only passive praise\\nThou owest! not alone these swelling tears,\\nMute thanks and secret ecstasy! Awake,\\nVoice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!\\nGreen vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn.\\n\\n  Thou first and chief, sole sovran of the vale!\\nOh, struggling with the darkness all the night,\\nAnd visited all night by troops of stars,\\nOr when they climb the sky, or when they sink--\\nCompanion of the morning star at dawn,\\nThyself Earth\\'s rosy star, and of the dawn\\nCoherald--wake, oh wake, and utter praise!\\nWho sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?\\nWho filled thy countenance with rosy light?\\nWho made thee parent of perpetual streams?\\n\\n  And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad!\\nWho called you forth from night and utter death,\\nFrom dark and icy caverns called you forth,\\nDown those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,\\nForever shattered, and the same forever?\\nWho gave you your invulnerable life,\\nYour strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,\\nUnceasing thunder, and eternal foam?\\nAnd who commanded (and the silence came),\\nHere let the billows stiffen, and have rest?\\n\\n  Ye icefalls! ye that from the mountain\\'s brow\\nAdown enormous ravines slope amain--\\nTorrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,\\nAnd stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!\\nMotionless torrents! silent cataracts!\\nWho made you glorious as the gates of Heaven\\nBeneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun\\nClothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers\\nOf loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?\\nGod!--let the torrents, like a shout of nations,\\nAnswer! and let the ice plains echo, God!\\nGod! sing ye meadow streams with gladsome voice!\\nYe pine groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds!\\nAnd they, too, have a voice, yon piles of snow,\\nAnd in their perilous fall shall thunder, God!\\n\\n  Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost!\\nYe wild goats sporting round the eagle\\'s nest!\\nYe eagles, playmates of the mountain storm!\\nYe lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!\\nYe signs and wonders of the elements!\\nUtter forth, God, and fill the hills with praise!\\n\\n  Thou, too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks,\\nOft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,\\nShoots downward, glittering through the pure serene,\\nInto the depth of clouds that veil thy breast--\\nThou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou\\nThat as I raise my head, awhile bowed low\\nIn adoration, upward from thy base,\\nSlow traveling, with dim eyes suffused with tears,\\nSolemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,\\nTo rise before me.--Rise, oh ever rise!\\nRise like a cloud of incense from the Earth!\\nThou kingly spirit throned among the hills,\\nThou dread embassador from Earth to Heaven,\\nGreat Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,\\nAnd tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,\\nEarth, with her thousand voices, praises God.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of McGuffey\\'s Sixth Eclectic Reader\\nby William Holmes McGuffey\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MCGUFFEY\\'S SIXTH ECLECTIC READER ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 16751.txt or 16751.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/7/5/16751/\\n\\nProduced by Don Kostuch\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at https://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
